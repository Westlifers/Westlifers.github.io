Let $\\mathscr D$ be a collection of subsets of $X$ that is maximal with respect to the finite intersection property.(a) Show that $x\\in \\bar D$ for every $D\\in\\mathscr D$ iff every open nbhd of $x$ belongs to $\\mathscr D$. Which implication uses maximality of $\\mathscr D$?(b) Let $D\\in\\mathscr D$. Show that if $A\\supset D$, then $A\\in\\mathscr D$(c) Show that if $X$ satisfies the $T_1$ axiom, there is at most one point belonging to $\\bigcap_{D\\in\\mathscr D}\\bar D$ (a) This is equivalent to saying that $x\\in\\bigcap_{D\\in\\mathscr D}\\bar D\\iff\\mathcal N(x)\\subset\\mathscr D$. If $x\\in\\bigcap_{D\\in\\mathscr D}\\bar D$, i.e. $\\forall D\\in\\mathscr D, x\\in\\bar D$. Then $\\forall U\\in\\mathcal N(x), U\\cap D\\neq\\emptyset$. By maximality of $\\mathscr D$, we have $U\\in\\mathscr D$. Thus we have proven $\\mathcal N(x)\\subset\\mathscr D$. Conversely, suppose $\\mathcal N(x)\\subset\\mathscr D$, using finite intersection property of $\\mathscr D$, we know that $\\forall U\\in\\mathcal N(x)\\subset\\mathscr D, D\\in\\mathscr D, U\\cap D\\neq\\emptyset$, which means exactly that $x\\in\\bar D$. (b) Let $\\mathscr D’=\\mathscr D\\cup\\lbrace A\\rbrace$, any finite intersection within $\\mathscr D’$ is either a finite intersection within $\\mathscr D$ (hence nonempty) or a finite intersection within $\\mathscr D$ with $A$: $A\\cap D_1\\cap…\\cap D_n$. Note that $A\\cap D_1\\cap…\\cap D_n\\supset D\\cap D_1\\cap…\\cap D_n$, the right side of which is a finite intersection within $\\mathscr D$, again nonempty. Therefore $\\mathscr D’$ has finite intersection property, and hence equals $\\mathcal D$. (c) THIS IS FALSE. $T_2$ is necessary for (c). A counterexample can be found here. Suppose there are $x\\neq y\\in\\bigcap_{D\\in\\mathscr D}\\bar D$, by (a) this means $\\mathcal N(x),\\mathcal N(y)\\subset\\mathscr D$. Use Hausdorff-ness we get disjoint open sets $U\\in\\mathcal N(x), V\\in\\mathcal N(y)$, which contradicts to finite intersection property of $\\mathscr D$. Ex.37.2 A collection $\\mathscr A$ of subsets of $X$ has the countable intersection property if every countable intersection of elements of $\\mathscr A$ is nonempty. Show that $X$ is a Lindelof space iff for every collection $\\mathscr A$ of subsets of $X$ having the countable intersection property, $$\\bigcap_{A\\in\\mathscr A}\\bar A$$ is nonempty. The proof is analogous to the closed set description of compact spaces. First suppose $X$ is Lindelof, and $\\mathscr A$ has countable intersection property. Let $\\mathscr B=\\lbrace X\\setminus \\bar A|A\\in\\mathscr A\\rbrace$. This is a family of open sets. Note that the countable intersection property of $\\mathscr A$ implies that countable union of $\\mathscr B$ cannot be the whole space $X$, i.e. $\\mathscr B$ has no countable subcovering. Therefore, provided $X$ is Lindelof, $\\mathscr B$ cannot be a covering. $\\cup\\mathscr B\\neq X\\iff\\bigcap_{A\\in\\mathscr A}\\bar A\\neq\\emptyset$ Conversely, suppose for every collection $\\mathscr A$ of subsets of $X$ having the countable intersection property, $\\bigcap_{A\\in\\mathscr A}\\bar A\\neq\\emptyset$. Let $\\mathscr A$ be an open covering of $X$, $\\mathscr B=\\lbrace X\\setminus A|A\\in\\mathscr A\\rbrace$. $\\mathscr B$ is a family of closed sets. That $\\mathscr A$ is a covering is equivalent to saying $\\cap\\mathscr B=\\emptyset$, thus it cannot have the countable intersection property, i.e. $\\exists \\lbrace A_n\\rbrace_n\\subset\\mathscr A$, s.t. $\\bigcap_n (X\\setminus A_n)=\\emptyset$. This shows that $\\lbrace A_n\\rbrace_n$ is a countable subcovering. Ex.37.3 Consider the three statements: (i) If $X$ is a set and $\\mathscr A$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ having th countable intersection property, then there is a collection $\\mathscr D$ of subsets of $X$ such that $\\mathscr D\\supset\\mathscr A$ and $\\mathscr D$ is maximal w.r.t the countable intersection property. (ii) Suppose $\\mathscr D$ is maximal w.r.t. the countable intersection property. Then countable intersections of elements of $\\mathscr D$ are in $\\mathscr D$. Furthermore, if $A$ is a subset of $X$ that intersects every element of $\\mathscr D$, then $A$ is an element of $\\mathscr D$. (iii) Products of Lindelof spaces are Lindelof.(a) Show that (i) and (ii) together imply (iii).(b) Show that (ii) holds.(c) Products of Lindelof spaces need not to be Lindelof (see §30). Therefore (i) does not hold. If one attempts to generalize the proof of Lemma 37.1 to the countable intersection property, at what point does the proof break down? (a) You can prove (a) by directly applying the proof of Theorem 37.3 and change only ‘compact’ to ‘Lindelof’ and ‘finite intersection property’ to ‘countable intersection property’. The fact about compact spaces used there has its corresponding version in Ex.37.2 and Lemma 37.2 has its generalization as (ii), so everything will go through. (b) This is a direct generalization of Lemma 37.2. Check it yourself. (c) Recall that $\\Bbb R_l$ is Lindelof while $\\Bbb R_l^2$ is not (Do you still remember why?). You will break down when you try to find a ‘maximum’ family because this time you have infinite steps to go. Ex.37.4 Here is another theorem whose proof uses Zorn’s lemma. Recall that if $A$ is a space and if $x,y\\in A$, we say that $x,y$ belong to the same quasicomponent of $A$ if there is no separation $A=C\\cup D$ of $A$ into two disjoint sets open in $A$ such that $x\\in C, y\\in D$.Theorem. Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Then $x, y$ belong to the same quasicomponent of $X$ iff they belong to the same component of $X$.(a) Let $\\mathscr A$ be a collection of all closed subspaces $A$ of $X$ such that $x, y$ lie in the same quasicomponent of $A$. Let $\\mathscr B$ be a subcollection of $\\mathscr A$that is simply ordered by proper inclusion. Show that the intersection of the elements of $\\mathscr B$ belongs to $\\mathscr A$. [Hint: Compare Exercise 11 of §26.](b) Show $\\mathscr A$ has a minimal element $D$.(c) Show $D$ is connected. (a) Following the hint, we mimic the proof of Ex.26.11. Suppose not, Let $B_0=\\bigcap\\mathscr B$. If there exist an open separation $C,D\\subset B_0$ s.t. $x\\in C, y\\in D$. Since $X$ is normal, we find disjoint open sets $C’, D’$ in $X$ s.t. $C\\subset C’, D\\subset D’$. Let’s consider sets of shape $B\\setminus(C’\\cup D’)$ where $B\\in\\mathscr B$. They are closed sets, and they cannot be empty for otherwise $C’\\cap B,D’\\cap B$ will be an open separation of $B$ s.t. $x,y$ lie in them respectively, contrary to the fact that $x,y$ are in the same quasicomponent. Therefore, they satisfies the finite intersection property as they are simply ordered. So $\\emptyset\\neq\\bigcap_{B\\in \\mathscr{B}}(B \\setminus (C’\\cup B’))=B_0 \\setminus(C’\\cup B’)=\\emptyset$, a contradiction. (b) Zorn’s lemma. (c) Recall $D$ is minimal s.t. $x.y$ are in the same quasicomponent. So if $D$ is not connected, there will be a separation for $D$, by definition of $D$, $x,y $ will lie in the same part of this separation. Thus this part will be a smaller closed set satisfying $x,y $ are in the same quasicomponent, a contradiction. Ex.37.5*§38. The Stone-Cech CompactificationEx.38.1 Verify the statements made in Example 4. Omitted. Ex.38.2 Show that the bounded continuous function $g:(0,1)\\to \\Bbb R$ defined by $g(x) =\\cos(1/x)$ cannot be extended to the compactification of Example 3. Define an imbedding $h : (0, 1) \\to [0, 1]^3$ such that the functions $x, \\sin(1/x), \\cos(1/x)$ are all extendable to the compactification induced by $h$. Firstly, $g $ is not extendable. Suppose not, if $g $ can be extended to a $\\bar g:\\overline S\\to \\Bbb R$, let $i:(0,1)\\to\\overline S$ be the embedding. We know in $\\Bbb R^2$ (and hence in $\\overline S$), $(1/n\\pi,0)\\to(0,0)$, so $\\bar g(i(1/n\\pi))\\to \\bar g(0,0)$. However, $\\bar g(i(1/n\\pi))=g(1/n\\pi)=(-1)^n$ doesn’t converge, a contradiction. Secondly, $h(x)=(x,\\sin(1/x),\\cos(1/x))$ will be a desired embedding, as you can readily check like in Stone compactification. Ex.38.3 Under what conditions does a metrizable space have a metrizable compactification? The answer is $C_2$ condition. If $X $ is a metrizable space with a metrizable compactification $Y $, then $Y $ is a compact metrizable space, hence Lindelof, hence $C_2$. So $X $ is $C_2$. Conversely, if $X $ is $C_2$, let $B_n $ be a countable basis for it. We refer to Ex.33.4. : Ex.33.4. Recall that A is a “$G_\\delta$ set” in $X $ if $A $ is the intersection of a countable collection of open sets of $X $.Theorem. Let $X $ be normal. There exists a continuous function $f : X \\to [0, 1]$ such that $f (x) = 0$ for $x \\in A$ and $f (x) &gt; 0$ for $x \\notin A$, if and only if $A$ is a closed $G_\\delta$ set in X.A function satisfying the requirements of this theorem is said to vanish precisely on $A $. And recall that every metrizable space is $T_6 $ space, that is to say, every closed set is $G_\\delta$. Therefore, we conclude that for each $n $, there exists an $f_n $ s.t. $f_n$ is vanishes precisely outside $B_n $. Now by the imbedding theorem (theorem 34.2) we can imbedding $X $ into $[0,1]^\\omega$, which is metrizable. Thus $X $ has a metrizable compactification, which is the closure of its image in $[0,1]^\\omega$ Ex.38.4 Let $Y$ be an arbitrary compactification of $Y$; let $\\beta(X)$ be the Stone-Cech compactification. Show there is a continuous surjective closed map $g : \\beta(X) \\to Y$ that equals the identity on $X$.[This exercise makes precise what we mean by saying that $\\beta(X)$ is the “maximal” compactification of $X$. It shows that every compactification of $X$ is equivalent to a quotient space of $\\beta(X)$.] As shown in the figure, let $j=\\beta(i)$ be the continuous extension of the embedding $i$. We show $\\beta(i)$ is surjective and closed. That it is closed follows from the fact that $j$ is a continuous map between compact Hausdorff spaces. Note that$$Y=\\mathrm{Cl}_Y i(X)=\\mathrm{Cl}_Y j(X)\\subset\\mathrm{Cl}_Yj(\\beta(X))=j(\\beta(X))$$The last equality follows from closedness of $j$. Ex.38.5 (a) Show that every continuous real-valued function defined on $S_\\Omega$ is “eventually constant.” [Hint: First prove that for each $\\epsilon$, there is an element $\\alpha$ of $S_\\Omega$ such that $|f(\\beta)-f(\\alpha)|&lt;\\epsilon$ for all $\\beta&gt;\\alpha$ Then let $\\epsilon=1/n$ for $n\\in\\Bbb Z_+$ and consider the corresponding points $\\alpha_n$.](b) Show that the one-point compactification of $S_\\Omega$ and the Stone-Cech compactification are equivalent.(c) Conclude that every compactification of $S_\\Omega$ is equivalent to the one-point compactification. We follow the hint. (a) Suppose contrary to the hint, i.e. $\\exists \\epsilon_0&gt;0, \\forall\\alpha,\\exists\\beta&gt;\\alpha$ s.t. $|f(\\beta)-f(\\alpha)|\\ge \\epsilon_0$. Now fix an arbitrary $\\alpha_1$, we have a corresponding $\\beta$, write it as $\\alpha_2$. Repeat this process, we will have an increasing sequence $\\alpha_n$ satisfying $|f(\\alpha_n)-f(\\alpha_{n+1})|\\ge \\epsilon_0$. Since there are countably many $\\alpha_n $, they have an upper bound. Let $\\alpha$ be their least upper bound. Clearly $\\alpha_n\\to\\alpha $. By continuity of $f $, there exists an open nbhd $U$ of $\\alpha$ s.t. $\\forall x\\in U, |f(x)-f(\\alpha)|&lt;\\epsilon_0/2$. Choose an $n$ such that $\\alpha_n, \\alpha_{n+1}\\in U$, then the above equation yields $|f(\\alpha_n)-f(\\alpha_{n+1})|&lt; \\epsilon_0$, a contradiction. (b) By the uniqueness of Stone compactification, it suffices to prove that one point compactification of $S_\\Omega$ satisfies the extension property. Let $f:S_\\Omega\\to\\Bbb R$ be continuous. By part (a) $f$ is eventually constant, say eventually be $r$. Let $g:\\overline{S_\\Omega}\\to\\Bbb R$ with $g|_{X_\\Omega}=f, g(\\Omega)=r$. It is easy to verify the continuity of $g $. Thus the one-point compactification is equivalent to the Stone compactification. (c) Let $Y$ be an arbitrary compactification. By ex.38.4 there exists a continuous surjective closed function $f: \\overline{S_\\Omega}\\to Y$. However, $f$ equals to identity on $X$. $f$ Being surjective, we conclude that $|Y\\setminus X|=1$ and $f$ is thus injective. Being closed and continuous, $f$ is thus a homeomorphism, proving equivalence. Ex.38.6 Let $X$ be completely regular. Show that $X$ is connected if and only if $\\beta(X)$ is connected. [Hint: If $X=A\\cup B$ is an separation of $X$, let $f(x)=0$ for $x\\in A$, $f(x)=1$ for $x\\in B$.] We will use an obvious equivalent characterization of connectedness, which you can prove directly: $X$ is connected if and only if every continuous function $X\\to 2$ is constant, where $2$ denotes the 2-point space with discrete topology (which is obviously compact Hausdorff). Suppose $\\beta X$ is connected. Let $f:X\\to 2$ be an continuous function and extend it to $g: \\beta X\\to 2$. $g$ is constant, so $f $ is constant. Therefore $X $ is connected. Conversely, suppose $X $ is connected. Since $X$ is dense in $\\beta X $, the connectedness of $X $ implies the connectedness of its closure, i.e. $\\beta X $. Ex.38.7 Let X be a discrete space; consider the space $\\beta X$.(a) Show that if $A\\subset X$, then $\\overline A$ and $\\overline{X-A}$ are disjoint, where the closures are taken in $\\beta X$.(b) Show that if $U$ is open in $\\beta X$, then $\\overline U$ is open in $\\beta X$.(c) Show that $\\beta X$ is totally disconnected. (a) (All closures below in this problem are taken in $\\beta X$) Since $X$ is discrete, there exists a continuous function $f: X\\to I $ s.t. $f(A)=0,f(X\\setminus A)=1$. Now extend it to $g: \\beta X\\to I$. Note that all the spaces involved are Hausdorff, so $g|_{\\overline A}$ is uniquely determined by $g|_A=f|_A$. Hence we have $g(\\overline A)=0$, similarly $g(\\overline{X\\setminus A})=1$. Hence disjoint. (b) This question is asking us to prove that $\\beta X$ is extremely disconnected. Similarly to part (a) we have a continuous $g:\\beta X\\to I $ s.t. $g(\\overline{X\\cap U})=0, g(\\overline{X\\setminus U})=1$. But this time notice that $X$ is dense, a standard argument shows $\\overline{X\\cap U}=\\overline{U}$, hence $g(\\overline{U})=0$. Next we prove $g(\\beta X\\setminus\\overline U)=1$. Suppose not, there exists an $x\\notin\\overline U $ s.t. $g(x)&lt;1$. By continuity we find an open nbhd $U_x$ of $x$ such that $U_x\\cap \\overline U=\\emptyset,g(U_x)&lt;1$. Since $X$ is dense, we have $X\\cap U_x\\neq\\emptyset$. However, $g$ is of value either $0$ or $1$ on $X$, $g(U_x\\cap X)&lt;1\\implies g(U_x\\cap X)=0\\implies U_x\\cap X\\subset X\\cap U$, contradicting to $U_x\\cap \\overline U=\\emptyset$. Therefore, $\\overline U=g^{-1}([0,1/2))$ is an open set. (c) We have a even more general result: An extremely disconnected space is totally disconnected. Let $A$ be a subset of at least two points, say $x\\neq y$. By Hausdorff-ness we have disjoint open sets $U,V$ such that $x\\in U, y\\in V$. Then $y\\notin\\overline U$, therefore $A\\cap\\overline U$ is an non-trivial clopen set of $A$. This implies that the only possible connected subspace are singletons. Ex.38.8 Show that $\\beta(\\Bbb Z_+)$ has cardinality at least as great as $I^I$ , where $I=[0,1]$. [Hint: The space $I^I$ has a countable dense subset.] Indeed, $I^I$ is separable. Actually, $\\mathfrak{c}$-product of separable spaces is still separable, where $\\mathfrak c$ denotes the cardinality of the reals. This is a special case of Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczery theorem. FYI see here. Here we don’t need that strong theorem. If you are familiar with analysis, consider the set of polynomials with rational coefficients, then apply Stone-Weierstrass theorem. Let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $I^I$. Since $\\Bbb Z_+$ is discrete, any bijection $f:\\Bbb Z_+\\to D$ is continuous. Extend it to Stone compactification, we get $g:\\beta\\Bbb Z_+\\to I^I$. Moreover, $\\mathrm{im}g\\supset D$, and notice that $g$ is a continuous function from a compact space to Hausdorff space, hence closed map. We conclude that $\\mathrm{im}g=\\overline{\\mathrm{im}g}\\supset\\overline D=I^I$. So $g$ is surjective. Ex.38.9 (a) If $X$ is normal and $y$ is a point of $\\beta(X)-X$, show that $y$ is not the limit of a sequence of points of $X$.(b) Show that if $X$ is completely regular and non-compact, then $\\beta(X)$ is not metrizable. (a) Suppose $y$ is the limit of $x_n\\in X$ and $y\\in\\beta X\\setminus X$, then the set $\\lbrace x_n\\rbrace_n\\cup\\lbrace y\\rbrace$ is compact, hence closed. Therefore, $\\lbrace x_n\\rbrace_n=(\\lbrace x_n\\rbrace_n\\cup\\lbrace y\\rbrace)\\cap X$ is closed in $X$. Next, we show $\\lbrace x_n\\rbrace_n$ is discrete as a subspace. For each $n $, we can separate $x_n,y$ by two disjoint open sets $U\\ni x_n,V\\ni y$ in $\\beta X$. Since $x_n\\to y$, $U$ will contain only finitely many $x_m$’s, say $x_{m_1},…,x_{m_k}$. Let $U’=U\\setminus\\lbrace x_{m_j}\\rbrace_{j=1}^k$. Then $U’\\cap X$ is an open nbhd of $x_n$ that intersects $\\lbrace x_n\\rbrace_n$ only on $x_n$, proving discreteness of $\\lbrace x_n\\rbrace_n$. Finally, we conclude the contradiction. Assign $f(x_n)=z_n=1/2+(-1)^n 1/2$, since $\\lbrace x_n\\rbrace_n$ is discrete, $f$ is continuous from $\\lbrace x_n\\rbrace_n$ to $I$. By Tietze’s extension theorem, we can extend $f$ to a continuous function $f: X\\to I$, and then extend it further to $\\beta X\\to I$. Thus, $f(y)=f(\\lim x_n)=\\lim f(x_n)=\\lim z_n$. But we know $z_n$ does not converge, a contradiction. (b) If $X$ is non-compact, then it is a proper subspace of $\\beta X$. So there exists an $y\\in\\beta X\\setminus X$. Since $X$ is dense, $y$ is a limit point of $X$. By part (a), there is no sequence converging to $y$, so $\\beta X$ does not satisfy the sequence lemma, thus not metrizable Ex.38.10 We have constructed a correspondence $X\\to\\beta X$ that assigns, to each completely regular space, its Stone-Cech compactification. Now let us assign, to each continuous map $f:X\\to Y$ of completely regular spaces, the unique continuous map $\\beta(f):\\beta(X)\\to\\beta(Y)$ that extends the map $i\\circ f$, where $i:Y\\to\\beta(Y)$ is the inclusion map. Verify the following:(i) If $\\mathbb 1_X:X\\to X$ is the identity map of $X$, then $\\beta(\\mathbb 1_X)$ is the identity map of $\\beta(X)$.(ii) If $f:X\\to Y$ and $g:Y\\to Z$, then $\\beta(g\\circ f)=\\beta(g)\\circ\\beta(f)$. These properties tell us that the correspondence we have constructed is what is called a functor; it is a functor from the “category” of completely regular spaces and continuous maps of such spaces, to the “category” of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps of such spaces. You will see these properties again in Part II of the book; they are fundamental in algebra and in algebraic topology. This is the only place of Part I of the book where category theory is mentioned. These problems are standard category technics. I’ll take part (ii) as example. Recall that the extension of a function to Stone compactification is unique. Both diagram above commute. So the bottom arrows equal.","link":"/2024/11/27/Munkres-Topology-Solution-Chapter-5/"},{"title":"Munkres Topology Solution: Chapter 6","text":"§39. Local FinitenessEx.39.1 Check the statements in Example 1. Omitted. Ex.39.2 Find a point-finite open covering $\\mathscr{A}$ of $\\Bbb R$ that is not locally finite.

Note that if different $A\\in\\mathscr{A}$ give different closure then the collection $\\mathscr{B}$ is definitely not locally finite. So the counterexample happens when closures of many $A\\in\\mathscr{A}$ coincide. For example, $\\lbrace A\\subset\\Bbb R|A\\supset\\Bbb Q\\rbrace$ will do. Ex.39.4 Let $\\mathscr{A}$ be the following collection of subsets of $\\Bbb R$:$$\\mathscr{A}=\\lbrace(n,n+2)|n\\in\\Bbb Z\\rbrace$$ Which of the following collections refine $\\mathscr{A}$?$$\\begin{cases} \\mathscr{B}=\\lbrace(x,x+1)|x\\in\\Bbb R\\rbrace\\\\ \\mathscr{C}=\\lbrace(n,n+3/2)|n\\in\\Bbb Z\\rbrace\\\\ \\mathscr{D}=\\lbrace(x,x+3/2)|x\\in\\Bbb R\\rbrace\\end{cases}$$ $\\mathscr{B},\\mathscr{C}$. Note that $(0.75,2.25)$ lies in $\\mathscr{D}$ but not in $\\mathscr{A}$. Ex.39.5 Show that if $X$ has a countable basis, a collection $\\mathscr{A}$ of subsets of $X$ is countably locally finite if and only if it is countable. If $\\mathscr{A }$ is countable, then it is of course countably locally finite. Conversely, if $\\mathscr{A }$ is countably locally finite, say $\\mathscr{A }=\\bigcup\\mathscr{A}_n$. Let $\\lbrace B_m\\rbrace$ be a countable basis for $X$. For each $n\\in\\Bbb Z,x\\in X$, there is an open nbhd $U_x$ of $x$ such that $U_x$ intersects finitely many elements of $\\mathscr{A}_n$. Choose an $B_m$ such that $x\\in B_m\\subset U_x$, then $B_m$ intersects finitely many elements of $\\mathscr{A}_n$. Therefore, we see that each $B_m$ intersects finitely many elements of $\\mathscr{A}_n$. Hence there are only countably many elements in $\\mathscr{A}_n$. Thus $\\mathscr{A}$ is countable. Ex.39.6 Consider $\\Bbb R^\\omega$ in the uniform topology. Given $n$, let $\\mathscr{B}_n$ be the collection of all subsets of $\\Bbb R^\\omega$ of the form $\\prod A_i$ , where $A_i=\\Bbb R$ for $i\\le n$ and $A_i$ equals either $\\lbrace 0\\rbrace$ or $\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$ otherwise. Show that the collection $\\mathscr{B}=\\bigcup_n\\mathscr{B}_n$ is countably locally finite, but neither countable nor locally finite. First, it is easy to see $\\mathscr{A}_n$ is even locally discrete: for each open ball $B(x,1/3)$, if it intersects two subsets of the form $\\prod A_i\\in\\mathscr{B}_n$, then we see $\\mathrm{diam}B(x,1/3)\\ge 1$, a contradiction. Second, $|\\mathscr{B}|=\\sum 2^{\\aleph_0}=\\aleph_0 2^{\\aleph_0}=\\mathfrak c$, uncountable. Finally, pick $0\\in\\Bbb R^\\omega$, then $0\\in\\Bbb R^{n}\\times\\prod_{i\\ge n+1}\\lbrace 0\\rbrace\\in\\mathscr{B}_n$ for each $n\\in\\Bbb Z^+$, thus any open nbhd of $0$ will intersect infinitely many elements in $\\mathscr{B}$ §40.

Ex.40.2 A subset $W$ of $X$ is said to be an “$F_\\sigma$ set” in $X$ if $W$ equals a countable union of closed sets of $X$. Show that $W$ is an $F_\\sigma$ set in $X$ if and only if $X-W$ is a $G_\\delta$ set in $X$.[The terminology comes from the French. The “F” stands for “fermé,” which means “closed,” and the “$\\sigma$” for “somme,” which means “union.”] Omitted. Ex.40.3 Many spaces have countable bases; but no $T_1$ space has a locally finite basis unless it is discrete. Prove this fact. Suppose $X$ is a $T_1$ space with a locally finite basis. We know that in a $T_1$ space, the intersection of all nbhd of a point $\\bigcap\\mathcal N(x)$ equals to the point itself. Let $\\mathscr{B}$ be a locally finite basis for $X$, $\\mathscr{C}$ a subcollection of it containing all basis element containing $x$. By local finiteness, there exists an open nbhd $U$ of $x$ such that $U$ intersects finitely many elements of $\\mathscr{C}$, say $C_1,…,C_n$. Then $\\lbrace x\\rbrace=\\bigcap\\mathcal N(x)=U\\cap C_1\\cap…\\cap C_n$ is an open set, proving the discreteness of $X$. Ex.40.4 Find a non-discrete space that has a countably locally finite basis but does not have a countable basis. By Lemma 39.2, every metrizable space has a countably locally finite basis. So it remains us to find a non-discrete, non-$C_2$ metrizable space. For example $\\Bbb R^\\omega$ in the uniform topology. Ex.40.5 A collection $\\mathscr{A}$ of subsets of $X$ is said to be locally discrete if each point of $X$ has a neighborhood that intersects at most one element of $\\mathscr{A}$. A collection $\\mathscr{B}$ is countably locally discrete (or “$\\sigma$-locally discrete”) if it equals a countable union of locally discrete collections. Prove the following:Theorem (Bing metrization theorem). A space $X$ is metrizable if and only if it is regular and has a basis that is countably locally discrete. I believe the proof is just a copy of Theorem 40.3. The only thing we need to do is converting the dependent lemmas into locally discrete version. I will list them below, the proof of which is exactly the same as their original version, changing some words. Lemma. Let $\\mathscr{A}$ be a collection of subsets of $X$ that is locally discrete.(1) Any subcollection of $\\mathscr{A}$ is locally discrete.(2) The collection $\\mathscr{B}=\\lbrace \\overline A|A\\in\\mathscr{A}\\rbrace$ is locally discrete.(3) $\\overline{\\bigcup_{A\\in\\mathscr{A}}A}=\\bigcup_{A\\in\\mathscr{A}}\\overline A$ Lemma. Let $X$ be a metrizable space. If $\\mathscr{A}$ is an open covering of $X$, then there is an open covering $\\mathscr{E}$ of $X$ refining $\\mathscr{A}$ that is countably locally discrete. Lemma. Let $X$ be a regular space with a basis $\\mathscr{B}$ that is countably locally discrete. Then $X$ is a $T_6$ space. That is to say, $X$ is normal, and every closed set in $X$ is a $G_\\delta$ set in $X$. Actually the proof of the original version of the last two lemmas in the textbook is already strong enough to prove the discrete version. §41 ParacompactnessEx.41.1 Give an example to show that if $X$ is paracompact, it does not follow that for every open covering $\\mathscr{A}$ of $X$, there is a locally finite subcollection of $\\mathscr{A}$ that covers $X$. Endow $\\Bbb Z$ with the order topology (the same as discrete topology), then $\\lbrace(-n,n)\\rbrace_n$ is an open covering of $\\Bbb Z$ without locally finite subcovering *Actually, we can show the following: TFAE(1) $X$ is compact.(2) Every open covering of $X$ has a locally finite subcovering.(3) Every open covering of $X$ has a point finite subcovering. The direction $(1)\\implies(2)\\implies(3)$ is obvious. For $(3)\\implies(1)$: Let $\\mathscr{A}=\\lbrace U_\\alpha\\rbrace$ be an open covering of $X$. Pick any element $U\\in\\mathscr{A}$ and form a new collection $\\mathscr{A}’=\\lbrace U\\cup U_\\alpha|U_\\alpha\\in\\mathscr{A}\\rbrace$. It is clear that $\\mathscr{A}’$ is an open covering of $X$. Then $\\mathscr{A}’$ has a point finite subcovering $\\mathscr{A}’’$. Now pick any point $x\\in U$. We can see every element of $\\mathscr{A}’’$ contains $x$. But $\\mathscr{A}’’$ is point finite. Therefore $\\mathscr{A}’’$ is finite, say $\\mathscr{A}’’=\\lbrace U\\cup U_\\alpha|\\alpha\\in F\\rbrace$ where $F$ is finite. Then $U, U_\\alpha,(\\alpha\\in F)$ covers $X$. Hence $X$ is compact. Ex.41.2 (a) Show that the product of a paracompact space and a compact space is paracompact. [Hint: Use the tube lemma.](b) Conclude that $S_\\Omega$ is not paracompact. (a) Let $X,Y$ be paracompact and compact respectively, and $\\mathscr{A}$ be an open covering of $X\\times Y$. Since $Y$ is compact, for each $x\\in X $, there exists finitely many open sets $U_n(x)\\in\\mathscr{A}$ that cover $\\lbrace x\\rbrace\\times Y$. By the tube lemma, each $U_n(x)$ actually contains a tube $U_x\\times Y$ where $U_x\\in\\mathcal N(x)$. Now, $\\lbrace U_x\\rbrace$ forms an open covering of $X$, thus having an open locally finite refinement $\\mathscr{B}$ that covers $X$. For each $V\\in\\mathscr{B}$, choose an $x=f(V)\\in X$ such that $V\\subset U_x$. Then, $\\lbrace U_n(f(V))\\cap (V\\times Y)\\rbrace_{V\\in\\mathscr{B},n}$ is an open covering of $X\\times Y$ that is locally finite and refines $\\mathscr{A}$, as you can readily check. (b) Suppose on the contrary $S_\\Omega$ is paracompact. Then $S_\\Omega\\times \\overline{S_\\Omega}$ is paracompact, by part (a). However, this will lead us to conclude that $S_\\Omega\\times \\overline{S_\\Omega}$ is $T_4$ (normal), which is false. Ex.41.3 Is every locally compact Hausdorff space paracompact? No, consider $S_\\Omega$. We have just proven that it is not paracompact. Ex.41.4 (a) Show that if $X$ has the discrete topology, then $X$ is paracompact.(b) Show that if $f:X\\to Y$ is continuous and $X$ is paracompact, the subspace $f(X)$ of $Y$ need not be paracompact. (a) If $\\mathscr{A}$ is an open covering of $X$, then $\\lbrace \\lbrace x\\rbrace\\subset X|\\exists U\\in\\mathscr{A},x\\in U\\rbrace$ is an open refinement of $\\mathscr{A}$ that covers $X$. (b) By part (a), we just need to find a non-paracompact space $X$, then consider the identity map $\\mathbb 1: X(\\mathrm{Discrete})\\to X$. For example, $S_\\Omega$. Ex.41.5 Let $X$ be paracompact. We proved a “shrinking lemma” for arbitrary indexed open coverings of $X$. Here is an “expansion lemma” for arbitrary locally finite indexed families in $X$.Lemma. Let $\\lbrace B_\\alpha\\rbrace_{\\alpha\\in J}$ be a locally finite indexed family of subsets of the paracompact Hausdorff space $X$. Then there is a locally finite indexed family $\\lbrace U_\\alpha\\rbrace_{\\alpha\\in J}$ of open sets in $X$ such that $B_\\alpha\\subset U_\\alpha$ for each $\\alpha$. We mimic the trick in Lemma 41.3, part $(3)\\implies(4)$. Write $\\mathscr{B}=\\set{B_\\alpha}$. For each point $x\\in X$, there is a neighborhood of $x$ that intersects only finitely many elements of $\\mathscr{B}$. The collection of all open sets that intersect only finitely many elements of $\\mathscr{B}$ is thus an open covering of $X$. There exists an locally finite open refinement of this collection that covers $X$, then form a collection $\\mathscr{C}$ that consists of closures of elements in this refinement. Then $\\mathscr{C}$ is an locally finite closed covering of $X$. Next, for each $B_\\alpha\\in\\mathscr{B}$, let $E(B_\\alpha)=X\\setminus\\bigcup_{C\\in\\mathscr{C}\\text{ and }C\\subset X\\setminus B_\\alpha}C$. Now follow the same argument in Lemma 41.3, you know $\\mathscr{U}=\\set{U_\\alpha}:=\\set{E(B_\\alpha)|\\alpha\\in J}$ is a locally finite open collection that covers $X$, satisfying $B_\\alpha\\subset U\\alpha$ for each $\\alpha$. Ex.41.6 (a) Let $X$ be a regular space. If $X$ is a countable union of compact subspaces of $X$, then $X$ is paracompact.(b) Show $\\Bbb R^\\infty$ is paracompact as a subspace of $\\Bbb R^\\omega$ in the box topology. (a) i.e. show that in $T_3$ cases, $\\sigma$-compact implies paracompact. Let $X=\\bigcup C_n$ where $C_n$ are compact in $X$. If $\\mathscr{A}$ is an open covering of $X$, for each $n$, there are finitely many elements in $\\mathscr{A}$ that covers $C_n$, denote it as $\\mathscr{D}_n$. Obviously $\\mathscr{D}_n$ is locally finite (since finite) so $\\mathscr{D}=\\bigcup\\mathscr{D}_n$ is countably locally finite and is an open covering of $X$. Thus, every open covering has a countably locally finite open refinement that covers $X$. By Lemma 41.3, $X$ is paracompact. Note that we actually proved $X$ is Lindelof! (b) $\\Bbb R^\\infty=\\bigcup_n \\Bbb R^n_*$, where $\\Bbb R^n_*=\\set{(x_i)_i\\in\\Bbb R^\\omega|x_i\\in\\Bbb R\\text{ for }i\\le n, x_i=0\\text{ otherwise}}\\cong\\Bbb R^n$ is compact. That $\\Bbb R^\\infty$ is $T_3$ (even $T_{3.5}$) in box topology is given in Ex.33.9, using the Urysohn Lemma. Ex.41.7 Let X be a regular space.(a) If $X$ is a finite union of closed paracompact subspaces of $X$, then $X$ is paracompact.(b) If $X$ is a countable union of closed paracompact subspaces of $X$ whose interiors cover $X$, show $X$ is paracompact. (a) Clearly we only need to show the case $n=2$. Suppose $X=A_1\\cup A_2$ where $A_i$ is closed paracompact subspace of $X$. For any open covering $\\mathscr{U}$ of $X$, the collection $\\mathscr{U}_i=\\set{U\\cap A_i|U\\in\\mathscr{U}}$ is an open covering of $A_i$, thus have a locally finite closed refinement $\\mathscr{U}_i’$. Since $A_i$ is closed, every element in $\\mathscr{U}_i’$ is also closed in $X$. So $\\mathscr{V}=\\mathscr{U}_1’\\cup\\mathscr{U}_2’$ is a closed covering of $X$. For each $x\\in X$, if $x\\in A_1$ then it has an open nbhd $U$ in $A_1$, such that $U$ intersects finitely many sets in $\\mathscr{U}_1’$. There exists an open set $U’$ of $X$ such that $U=U’\\cap A_1$. Similarly if $x\\in A_2$ there exists an open set $V’$ of $X$ such that $V=V’\\cap A_2$ intersects finitely many sets in $\\mathscr{U}_2’$. Note that $U’$ still intersects only finitely many elements in $\\mathscr{U}_1’$ and similar to $V’$ Now consider two open sets $U’\\setminus A_2, V’\\setminus A_1$ of $X$. Note that $U’\\setminus A_2\\subset U, V’\\setminus A_1\\subset V$, and neither $U’\\setminus A_2$ intersect any element in $\\mathscr{U}_2’$ nor $V’\\setminus A_1$ intersect any element in $\\mathscr{U}_1’$. So, if $x\\notin A_1$ then $W=U’\\setminus A_2$ is a open nbhd of $x$ that intersects only finitely many elements in $\\mathscr{V}$, and $x\\notin A_1$ is similar. In the case $x\\in A_1\\cap A_2$, choose $W=U’\\cap V’$ and note that $W\\subset U’,V’$. Thus $\\mathscr{V}$ is locally finite. By Lemma 41.3, $X$ is paracompact. *This problem is not hard, but also not so obvious like some readers might think. Note that unlike compactness, it is NOT correct that a subspace $Y\\subset X$ is paracompact iff every open covering of $Y$ consisting of open sets of $X$ has locally finite open (in the sense of $X$) refinement that covers $Y$. (b) Let $\\mathscr{U}$ be an open covering of $X=\\bigcup X_n$ with $\\bigcup(X_n)^\\circ=X$. For each $n$, $\\mathscr{U}_n=\\set{U\\cap X_n|U\\in\\mathscr{U}}$ is an open covering of $X_n$. Thus there is a family $\\mathscr{V}_n’$ of open subsets of $X$ which has the property that $\\set{V\\cap X_n|V\\in\\mathscr{V}’_n}$ is a locally-finite open refinement (in $X_n$) of $\\mathscr{U}_n$. Write $\\mathscr{V}_n=\\set{V\\cap(X_n)^\\circ|V\\in\\mathscr{V}’_n}$ to obtain a locally-finite family of open subsets of $X$ which covers the interior $(X_n)^\\circ$ and refines $\\mathscr{U}_n$. The collection $\\mathscr{V}=\\bigcup\\mathscr{V}_n$ is now a countably locally finite open refinement of $\\mathscr{U}$ covering $X$. By Lemma 41.3, $X$ is paracompact Ex.41.8 Let $p:X\\to Y$ be a perfect map. (See Exercise 7 of §31.)(a) Show that if $Y$ is paracompact, so is $X$. [Hint: If $\\mathscr{A}$ is an open covering of $X$, find a locally finite open covering of $Y$ by sets $B$ such that $p^{-1}(B)$ can be covered by finitely many elements of $\\mathscr{A}$; then intersect $p^{-1}(B)$ with these elements of $\\mathscr{A}$.](b) Show that if $X$ is a paracompact Hausdorff space, then so is $Y$. [Hint: If $\\mathscr{B}$ is a locally finite closed covering of $X$, then $\\set{p(B)|B\\in\\mathscr{B}}$ is a locally finite closed covering of $Y$.] (a) Recall that perfect map is a surjective continuous map that is closed with compact fibers. If $\\mathscr{A}$ is an open covering of $X$. WLOG we may assume $\\mathscr{A}$ is closed under finite unions. Let $\\mathscr{B}=\\set{Y\\setminus f(X\\setminus A)|A\\in\\mathscr{A}}$. It is clear that $\\mathscr{B}$ is a collection of open sets of $Y$. And since $f$ has compact fibers and $\\mathscr{A}$ is closed under finite unions, each fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ is contained in an $A\\in\\mathscr{A}$. Thus,$$\\begin{aligned}X\\setminus f^{-1}(y)&amp;\\supset X\\setminus A\\\\f(X\\setminus f^{-1}(y))&amp;\\supset f(X\\setminus A)\\\\Y\\setminus f(X\\setminus f^{-1}(y))&amp;\\subset Y\\setminus f(X\\setminus A)\\\\=Y\\setminus f f^{-1}(Y\\setminus\\set{y})&amp;\\\\=\\set{y}&amp;\\end{aligned}$$Therefore, $\\mathscr{B}$ covers $Y$. So it has a locally finite open refinement $\\mathscr{B}’$ that covers $Y$. Now let $\\mathscr{A}’=\\set{f^{-1}(B’)|B’\\in\\mathscr{B}’}$. This is an open covering of $Y$. It refines $\\mathscr{A}$, because for each $A’=f^{-1}(B’)\\in\\mathscr{A}’$ where $B’\\in\\mathscr{B}’$, there exists an $A\\in\\mathscr{A}$ such that $B’\\subset Y\\setminus f(X\\setminus A)$. Hence,$$\\begin{aligned}A’&amp;\\subset f^{-1}(Y\\setminus f(X\\setminus A))\\\\&amp;= X\\setminus f^{-1}f(X\\setminus A)\\\\&amp;\\subset A\\end{aligned}$$Therefore, $\\mathscr{A}’$ refines $\\mathscr{A}$. As for locally finiteness, for each $x\\in X,\\exists V\\ni f(x)$, s.t. $V$ intersects finitely many $B’\\in\\mathscr{B}’$, then $f^{-1}V$ intersects those $f^{-1}B’$. Moreover, if $f^{-1}V\\cap f^{-1}B’\\neq\\emptyset$, we have $\\emptyset\\neq f(f^{-1}V\\cap f^{-1}B’)\\subset V\\cap B’$, meaning that $f^{-1}V$ will only intersect those elements, thus locally finite. (b) Recall in Ex.31.7 we have proved that if $f:X\\to Y$ is perfect map, then $X$ regular implies $Y$ regular. Here $X$ is paracompact Hausdorff, hence regular, hence $Y$ is regular. Let $\\mathscr{U}$ be an open covering of $Y $, take the preimages to form an $\\mathscr{A}$, which has a closed locally finite refinement $\\mathscr{A}’$ that covers $X$. Let $\\mathscr{B}$ be the images of elements of $\\mathscr{A}’$. Now clearly $\\mathscr{B}$ is a closed covering of $Y$. It refines $\\mathscr{A}$, for if $B\\in\\mathscr{B}$, there exists $A’\\in\\mathscr{A}’,A\\in\\mathscr{A},U\\in\\mathscr{U}$ such that: $B=f(A’)\\subset f(A)=ff^{-1}(U)=U$. Now we prove locally finiteness. For each $y\\in Y$, its fiber is compact, thus can be covered by finitely many open sets, each of which intersects finitely many elements in $\\mathscr{A}’$, i.e. $f^{-1}y\\subset M=\\bigcup A_i’$ . Therefore, $y\\in f(\\bigcup A_i’)$. Closed maps send nbhd to nbhd (in particular, in part (a) we proved $N=Y\\setminus f(X\\setminus A)\\subset f(A)$), so there exists $N$ such that $y\\in N\\subset f(M)$. Similarly we can prove $f^{-1}N\\subset M$. Hence $f^{-1}N$ intersects finitely many elements of $\\mathscr A’$. Similar to the end of part (a), we know $N$ intersects at most finitely many elements of $\\mathscr B$. Ex.41.10 Theorem. If $X$ is a Hausdorff space that is locally compact and paracompact, then each component of $X$ has a countable basis.Proof. If $X_0$ is a component of $X$, then $X_0$ is locally compact and paracompact. Let $\\mathscr{C}$ be a locally finite covering of $X_0$ by sets open in $X_0$ that have compact closures. Let $U_1$ be a nonempty element of $\\mathscr{C}$, and in general let $U_n$ be the union of all elements of $\\mathscr{C}$ that intersect $\\overline{U_{n-1}}$. Show $\\overline{U_n}$ is compact, and the sets $U_n$ cover $X_0$. THIS IS FALSE. A correction may be changing ‘paracompact’ to ‘metrizable’. After correction, it is equivalent to proving locally compact connected metrizable space is $C_2$. We show $X$ is a countable union of $C_2$ open subspaces, thus is $C_2$. We follow the hint. Since $X$ is locally compact, those open sets with compact closures form an open covering. Let $\\mathscr{C}$ be a locally finite open refinement of it covering $X$ and $\\emptyset\\neq U_1\\in\\mathscr{C}$, $U_2=\\bigcup\\set{U\\in\\mathscr{C}|U\\cap\\overline{U_1}\\neq\\emptyset}$,…,$U_{n+1}=\\bigcup\\set{U\\in\\mathscr{C}|U\\cap\\overline{U_n}\\neq\\emptyset}$. We prove by induction that $\\overline{U_n}$ is compact. It is clear that $\\overline{U_1}$ is compact. Now suppose $\\overline{U_n}$ is compact. Since $\\mathscr{C}$ is locally finite, for each $x\\in\\overline{U_n}$, there is an open nbhd $U_x$ of $x$ such that $U_x$ intersects only finitely many elements in $\\mathscr{C}$. Since $\\overline{U_n}$ is compact, we can cover it by finitely many such $U_x$. In particular, $\\overline{U_n}$ intersects only finitely many elements of $\\mathscr{C}$. By definition, we know that $U_{n+1}$ is a finite union of $U\\in\\mathscr{C}$. Therefore, $\\overline{U_{n+1}}$ is compact. Hence we conclude all $\\overline{U_n}$ are compact. Now we show $X=\\bigcup U_n$, where connectedness is used. Let $x\\in\\overline{\\bigcup U_n}$. Every open nbhd of it intersects $\\bigcup U_n$, or equivalently, intersects some $U_n$, hence $\\overline{U_n}$. By definition, $x\\in U_{n+1}$. Therefore, $x\\in\\bigcup U_n$, i.e. $\\overline{\\bigcup U_n}=\\bigcup U_n$. Hence $\\bigcup U_n$ is a non-empty clopen set. By connectedness, $\\bigcup U_n=X$ Finally, we have $X=\\bigcup\\overline{U_n}$. Each $\\overline{U_n}$ is a compact metrizable space, hence $C_2$. Being open subspace of $\\overline{U_n}$, $U_n$ is $C_2$. Thus we come to our conclusion. §42 The Smirnov Metrization TheoremEx.42.1 Compare Theorem 42.1 with Exercises 7 and 8 of §34. There are three theorems concerning local metrizability. I list them below: In the following spaces, local metrizability is equivalent to metrizability.(1) compact Hausdorff spaces (Ex.34.7)(2) Lindelof regular spaces (Ex.34.8)(3) paracompact Hausdorff spaces (Theorem 42.1) Ex.42.2 (a) Show that for each $x\\in S_\\Omega$, the section of $S_\\Omega$ by $x$ has a countable basis and hence is metrizable.(b) Conclude that $S_\\Omega$ is not paracompact. (a) For each $x\\in S_\\Omega$, denote $S_x$ its section. All open intervals in $S_x$ form a basis of $S_x$. The cardinality is $\\aleph_0^2=\\aleph_0$, hence $S_x$ is $C_2$. By the Urysohn lemma, $S_x$ is metrizable. (b) By part (a), $S_\\Omega$ is locally metrizable. If moreover $S_\\Omega$ is paracompact, then it is metrizable. However, this is false. (Recall that $S_\\Omega$ is not compact but is limit point compact).","link":"/2025/01/09/Munkres-Topology-Solution-Chapter-6/"},{"title":"Munkres Topology Solution: Chapter 7","text":"§43 Complete Metric SpacesEx.43.1 Let X be a metric space.(a) Suppose that for some $\\epsilon&gt;0$, every $\\epsilon$-ball in $X$ has compact closure. Show that $X$ is complete.(b) Suppose that for each $x\\in X$ there is an $\\epsilon&gt;0$ such that the ball $B(x,\\epsilon)$ has compact closure. Show by means of an example that $X$ need not be complete. (a) Let $\\set{x_n}$ be a Cauchy sequence of $X$. For large enough $N$, $\\forall m,n\\ge N$, we have $d(x_m,x_n)&lt;\\epsilon/2$. Therefore the open ball $B(x_N,\\epsilon)$ covers all but finitely many $x_n$’s. So $\\set{x_n}$ is covered by finitely many $\\epsilon$-ball, hence covered by their closures, which is compact. Compactness implies sequential compactness, so $\\set{x_n}$ has convergent subsequence. Being Cauchy, it converges. (b) $(0,1)$ Ex.43.2 Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces; let $Y$ be complete. Let $A\\subset X$. Show that if $f : A \\to Y$ is uniformly continuous, then $f$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous function $g : \\overline A \\to Y$ , and $g$ is uniformly continuous. In proceeding problems I will not distinguish $d_X,d_Y…$, i.e. I will omit subscripts. Usually this will not lead confusion. Metric spaces are Hausdorff, so $f$ can indeed uniquely extend to the closure of its domain. Now we prove $g$ is uniformly continuous. For every $\\epsilon&gt;0$, let $x,y\\in\\overline A$. We have sequences $x_n\\to x,y_n\\to y$. By uniform continuity, there exists $\\delta$ such that once $x’,y’\\in A$ satisfies $d(x’,y’)&lt;\\delta$, we have $d(f(x’),f(y’))&lt;\\epsilon/2$. Now let $d(x,y)\\le\\delta/2$ and $N$ large enough so that $d(x,x_n)&lt;\\delta/4, d(y,y_n)&lt;\\delta/4$ hold for $n\\ge N$. Then for such $n$ we have $d(x_n, y_n)&lt;\\delta$. Therefore,$$\\begin{aligned}d(f(x),f(y))\\le&amp; d(f(x),f(x_n))+d(f(x_n),f(y_n))+d(f(y_n),f(y))\\\\\\le&amp; d(f(x),f(x_n))+d(f(y_n),f(y)) + \\epsilon/2\\end{aligned}$$Let $n\\to\\infty$ we have $d(f(x),f(y))\\le\\epsilon/2&lt;\\epsilon$. Ex.43.3 Two metrics $d$ and $d’$ on a set $X$ are said to be metrically equivalent if the identity map $i : (X, d) → (X, d’)$ and its inverse are both uniformly continuous.(a) Show that d is metrically equivalent to the standard bounded metric $\\overline d$ derived from $d$.(b) Show that if $d$ and $d’$ are metrically equivalent, then $X$ is complete under $d$ if and only if it is complete under $d’$. You may interpret metrically equivalent as one metric will dominate the other: if $d$ is sufficiently small, then $d’$ will be sufficiently small and vice versa. (a) In the interpretation above, this is clear. (b) A sequence $\\set{x_n}$ is Cauchy in the sense of $d$ if and only if it is Cauchy in then sense of $d’$. And it converges in the sense of $d$ if and only if it converges in then sense of $d’$. Ex.43.4 Show that the metric space $(X, d)$ is complete if and only if for every nested sequence $A_1\\supset A_2\\supset…$ of nonempty closed sets of X such that $\\newcommand\\diam{\\mathrm{diam}}$ $\\diam A_n\\to 0$, the intersection of the sets $A_n$ is nonempty. First, suppose $X$ is complete under $d$. Choose, for each $n$, an $x_n\\in A_n$. Then since $\\diam A_n\\to 0$, we know $\\set{x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence. hence converges to some $x$. Because $A_n$ are closed, $x\\in A_n$ for each $n$. Therefore, $x\\in\\bigcap A_n$. Conversely, suppose $X$ satisfies the nested closed sets condition. Let $\\set{x_n}$ be a Cauchy sequence. Suppose on the contrary it doesn’t converge, i.e. it has no limit point. Then it is closed. Similarly $A_N:=\\set{x_N,x_{N+1},…}$ is closed for each $n$. $\\set{x_n}$ being Cauchy implies $\\diam A_n\\to 0$. So $\\bigcap A_n\\neq\\emptyset$. However, by definition, $\\bigcap A_n=\\emptyset$. Ex.43.5 If $(X, d)$ is a metric space, recall that a map $f : X \\to X$ is called a contraction if there is a number $α &lt; 1$ such that $d( f (x), f (y)) ≤ \\alpha d(x, y)$ for all $x, y\\in X$. Show that if $f$ is a contraction of a complete metric space, then there is a unique point $x ∈ X$ such that $f(x) = x$. Compare Exercise 7 of §28. This a well known theorem from calculus. I will skip. Ex.43.6 A space $X$ is said to be topologically complete if there exists a metric for the topology of $X$ relative to which $X$ is complete.(a) Show that a closed subspace of a topologically complete space is topologically complete.(b) Show that a countable product of topologically complete spaces is topologically complete (in the product topology).(c) Show that an open subspace of a topologically complete space is topologically complete. [Hint: If $U\\subset X$ and $X$ is complete under the metric $d$, define $\\phi : U\\to R$ by the equation $\\phi(x) = 1/d(x, X − U)$. Imbed $U$ in $X\\times R$ by setting $f (x) = x\\times \\phi(x)$.](d) Show that if $A$ is a $G_\\delta$ set in a topologically complete space, then $A$ is topologically complete. [Hint: Let $A$ be the intersection of the open sets $U_n$, for $n\\in\\Bbb Z_+$. Consider the diagonal imbedding $f (a) = (a, a,… )$ of $A$ into $\\prod U_n$.] Conclude that the irrationals are topologically complete. (a) Clear. (b) This has been proven in previous chapters. Recall: set $\\overline\\rho(x,y)=\\sup_i{\\frac{d_{i}(x_i,y_i)}{i}}$ where $d_i$ is metric for $X_i$ relative to which $X_i$ is complete. (c) Define $\\phi : U\\to R$ by the equation $\\phi(x) = 1/d(x, X − U)$. Define furthermore $D(x,y)=d(x,y)+|\\phi(x)-\\phi(y)|$. It is clear $D$ is a metric on $U$. Now we prove it induces the subspace topology. Actually, since we know $\\phi$ is continuous, $d(x_n,x)\\to 0\\iff D(x_n,x)\\to 0$. Therefore, they determine the same convergency structure, hence induce the same topology. Finally we prove completeness. If $\\set{x_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence w.r.t. $D$, then since $D\\ge d$, we see $\\set{x_n}$ is Cauchy sequence w.r.t. $d$. Therefore, there exists an $x$ s.t. $d(x_n,x)\\to 0$, hence $D(x_n,x)\\to 0$ by continuity of $f$. (d) Suppose $A=\\cap_n U_n\\subset X$ and put $L=X^\\Bbb N,S=\\prod U_n\\subset L$. The diagonal imbedding $f:A\\to L$ is a topological embedding (You may check this if you are not sure). By Hausdorffness $f(A)$ is closed in $L$ hence closed in $S$. Therefore $A\\cong f(A)$ is complete. Ex.43.7 Show that the set of all sequences $(x_1, x_2,…)$ such that $\\sum x_i^2$ converges is complete in the $l^2$-metric. (See Exercise 8 of §20.) Standard result in analysis, omitted. Ex.43.8 If $X$ and $Y$ are spaces, define$$e : X \\times \\mathcal C(X, Y) \\to Y$$ by the equation $e(x, f) = f(x)$; the map $e$ is called the evaluation map. Show that if $d$ is a metric for $Y$ and $C(X, Y)$ has the corresponding uniform topology, then $e$ is continuous. We shall generalize this result in §46. For all $(x,f)\\in X \\times \\mathcal C(X, Y)$, let $B=B_d(f(x),\\epsilon)$ be an open ball nbhd of $e(x,f)=f(x)$. Consider the open nbhd $U=f^{-1}(B_d(f(x),\\epsilon/2)\\times B_{\\overline\\rho}(f,\\epsilon/2))$ of $(x,f)$, where $\\overline\\rho$ denotes the uniform metric. If $(y,g)\\in U$, then $d(g(y),f(x))\\le d(g(y),f(y))+d(f(y),f(x))\\le \\overline\\rho(g,f)+d(f(y),f(x))\\le \\epsilon/2+\\epsilon/2=\\epsilon$. Hence $e(y,g)\\in B$, which implies continuity of $e$. Ex.43.9 Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Show that there is an isometric imbedding $h$ of $X$ into a complete metric space $(Y, D)$, as follows: Let $\\tilde{X}$ denote the set of all Cauchy sequences$$\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots)$$ of points of $X$. Define $\\mathbf{x} \\sim \\mathbf{y}$ if$$d(x_n, y_n) \\longrightarrow 0.$$ Let $[\\mathbf{x}]$ denote the equivalence class of $\\mathbf{x}$; and let $Y$ denote the set of these equivalence classes. Define a metric $D$ on $Y$ by the equation$$D([\\mathbf{x}], [\\mathbf{y}]) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} d(x_n, y_n).$$ (a) Show that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation, and show that $D$ is a well-defined metric.(b) Define $h : X \\to Y$ by letting $h(x)$ be the equivalence class of the constant sequence $(x, x, \\ldots)$$$h(x) = [(x, x, \\ldots)].$$ Show that $h$ is an isometric imbedding.(c) Show that $h(X)$ is dense in $Y$; indeed, given $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots) \\in \\tilde{X}$, show the sequence $h(x_n)$ of points of $Y$ converges to the point $[\\mathbf{x}]$ of $Y$.(d) Show that if $A$ is a dense subset of a metric space $(Z, \\rho)$, and if every Cauchy sequence in $A$ converges in $Z$, then $Z$ is complete.(e) Show that $(Y, D)$ is complete. Ex.43.10 Theorem (Uniqueness of the completion). Let $ h : X \\to Y $ and $ h’ : X \\to Y’ $ be isometric imbeddings of the metric space $(X, d)$ in the complete metric spaces $(Y, D)$ and $(Y’, D’)$, respectively. Then there is an isometry of $(h(X), D)$ with $(h’(X), D’)$ that equals $h’h^{-1}$ on the subspace $h(X)$. §44 A Space-Filling CurveEx.44.1 Given $n$, show there is a continuous surjective map $g : I \\to I^n$. [Hint: Consider$f \\times f : I \\times I \\to I^2 \\times I^2$.] We have surjections $I\\xrightarrow{f} I^2\\xrightarrow{f\\times f} I^4\\to…\\to I^{2^n}$. Composite with an projection then we are done. Ex.44.2 Show there is a continuous surjective map $f : \\Bbb R \\to \\Bbb R^n$. Similar to Ex.44.1, we only need a surjection $g:\\Bbb R\\to\\Bbb R^2$. Let $f_k$ be the surjection $I\\to [-k,k]^2$, this can be done by a multiplication on the Peano curve. Next define $g:[0,\\infty)\\to \\Bbb R^2$ as: $g|_{[n-1,n]}(x)=f_n(x-n+1)$. This is well defined and surjective. It’s continuity is guaranteed by the pasting lemma. Let me note again that the pasting lemma is still valid on a locally-finite family of closed sets. It is easy to construct the desired surjection through $g$. Ex.44.3 (a) If $\\mathbb{R}^\\omega$ is given the product topology, show there is no continuous surjective map $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}^\\omega$. [Hint: Show that $\\mathbb{R}^\\omega$ is not a countable union of compact subspaces.](b) If $\\mathbb{R}^\\omega$ is given the product topology, determine whether or not there is a continuous surjective map of $\\mathbb{R}$ onto the subspace $\\mathbb{R}^\\infty$.(c) What happens to the statements in (a) and (b) if $\\mathbb{R}^\\omega$ is given the uniform topology or the box topology? (a) We follow the hint. Note that $\\sigma$-compactness is preserved by continuous map, so it suffices to show $\\Bbb R^\\omega$ is not $\\sigma$-compact. Suppose for the contrary, $\\Bbb R^\\omega=\\bigcup C_n$. Because $\\Bbb R$ is not compact, we can choose for each $n$, an $x_n\\in\\Bbb \\setminus\\pi_n(C_n)$. Thus, let $x=(x_n)$, we have $\\pi_n(x)=x_n\\notin\\pi_n(C_n)$, hence $x\\notin C_n$. Therefore, $x\\notin\\bigcup C_n$, a contraction. (b) Yes. By Ex.44.1 and suitable scalings, we have continuous surjections $f_n:[n,n+1]\\to [-n, n]^n$. WLOG we can assume $f_n(n+1)=f_{n+1}(n+1)$, pasting lemma works again to give continuous surjection $f: [0,\\infty)\\to \\bigcup [-n,n]^n=\\Bbb R^\\infty$. (c) For $\\Bbb R^\\omega$, no. Because otherwise the continuous surjection is also continuos under product topology (since product topology is coarsest). For $\\Bbb R^\\infty$, yes. Because what we constructed in (b) is continuous in all three topology (they coincide in finite-dimensional spaces). Ex.44.4 (a) Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. Show that if there is a continuous surjective map $f : I \\to X$, then $X$ is compact, connected, weakly locally connected, and metrizable. [Hint: Show $f$ is a perfect map.](b) The converse of the result in (a) is a famous theorem of point-set topology called the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem (see [H-Y], p. 129). Assuming this theorem, show there is a continuous surjective map $f : I \\to I^\\omega$. A Hausdorff space that is the continuous image of the closed unit interval is often called a Peano space. (a) Compactness and connectedness are obvious. For metrizability, we follow the hint. $f$ is continuous surjective, and every fiber is closed in $I$, hence compact, hence $f$ is a perfect map. By Ex.31.7, $X$ is both regular and second countable, hence metrizable. As for weakly locally connectedness, note that $f$ is a closed map, and closed map will map nbhd to nbhd. (b) We need to show that $I^\\omega$ is: compact, connected, weakly locally connected, and metrizable. Compactness follows from Tychonoff’s theorem. Any product of connected (resp. metrizable) space is connected (resp. metrizable) (Ex.23.10). $I^\\omega$ is even locally connected ($\\prod X_n$ is locally connected iff every $X_n$ is locally connected and all but finitely many $X_n$ are connected). §45 Compactness in Metric SpacesEx.45.1 If $X_n$ is metrizable with metric $d_n$, then $D(x, y) = \\sup{\\bar d_i (x_i , y_i )/i }$ is a metric for the product space $X = \\prod X_n$. Show that $X$ is totally bounded under $D$ if each $X_n$ is totally bounded under $d_n$. Conclude without using the Tychonoff theorem that a countable product of compact metrizable spaces is compact. That $D$ induces product topology has been proven in previous chapters. Now, if every $d_n$ is totally bounded, that is, for every $\\epsilon&gt;0$, there are finitely many open balls $\\set{B_i^n}_i$ of radius $\\epsilon$ centering at $x^i_n$ that cover $X_n$. Let $N$ large enough so that $1/N&lt;\\epsilon$. Now for any point $y=(y_n)\\in X$, for each $i\\le N$, we have $y_i\\in B_i^{k_i}(x_i^{k_i},\\epsilon)$ for some $k_i$. Thus $y\\in B_D((x_1^{k_1},\\dots,x_N^{k_N},x_{N+1}^0,\\dots),\\epsilon)$, where $(x_j^0)$ is a fixed point in $X$. Therefore, $\\set{B_D(x_1^{k_1},\\dots,x_N^{k_N},x^0_{N+1},\\dots)}$ is a finite set of open balls covering $X$. For the last statement, note that if every $X_n$ is compact, they are totally bounded and complete. By the above we know $D$ is totally bounded, and that $D$ is complete is proven in previous chapters. Hence $(X, D)$ is compact. Ex.45.2 Let $(Y, d)$ be a metric space; let $\\mathcal F$ be a subset of $C(X, Y)$.(a) Show that if $\\mathcal F$ is finite, then $\\mathcal F$ is equicontinuous.(b) Show that if $f_n$ is a sequence of elements of $C(X, Y)$ that converges uniformly, then the collection $\\set{f_n}$ is equicontinuous.(c) Suppose that $\\mathcal F$ is a collection of differentiable functions $f : \\Bbb R\\to\\Bbb R$ such that each $x\\in\\Bbb R$ lies in a neighborhood $U$ on which the derivatives of the functions in $\\mathcal F$ are uniformly bounded. [This means that there is an $M$ such that $|f’(x)|\\le M$ for all $f$ in $\\mathcal F$ and all $x\\in U$.] Show that $\\mathcal F$ is equicontinuous. (a) For every $\\epsilon&gt;0, x\\in X$, choose open nbhd $U_i$ of $x$ s.t. $\\forall z\\in U_i$, $f_i(z)\\in B(f(x),\\epsilon)$. Let $U=\\bigcap U_i$ then we are done. (b) Suppose $f_n$ converges to $f$, obviously $f$ is continuous. For every $\\epsilon&gt;0, x\\in X$, choose open nbhd $U$ of $x$ s.t. $f(U)\\subset B(f(x), \\epsilon/2)$. Since $f_n$ converges uniformly, for large enough $N$, if $n&gt;N$ we have $\\bar\\rho(f_n, f)&lt;\\epsilon/2$, in particular, $f_n(U)\\subset B(f(x),\\epsilon)$. Now, for $f_1,\\dots,f_N$, we can choose $U_1,\\dots,U_N$ such that $f_i(U_i)\\subset B(f(x),\\epsilon)$. Let $U=U\\cap\\bigcap U_i$ then we are done. An alternative proof would be: $\\set{f_n}_n\\cup\\set{f}$ is compact in uniform topology, hence totally bounded. Therefore $\\set{f_n}_n$ is totally bounded, hence equicontinuous. (c) Use the mean value theorem. Ex.45.3 Prove the following:Theorem (Arzela’s theorem). Let $X$ be compact; let $f_n\\in C(X,\\Bbb R^k)$. If the collection $\\set{f_n}$ is pointwise bounded and equicontinuous, then the sequence $f_n$ has a uniformly convergent subsequence. By Ascoli’s theorem, $\\mathcal{\\overline F}$ is compact in uniform topology, so every sequence has a convergent subsequence. Ex.45.4 (a) Let $f_n : I\\to \\Bbb R$ be the function $f_n(x) = x^n$. The collection $F = \\set{f_n}$ is pointwise bounded but the sequence $(f_n)$ has no uniformly convergent subsequence; at what point or points does $F$ fail to be equicontinuous?(b) Repeat (a) for the functions $f_n$ of Exercise 9 of §21. (a) Failure point is $x=1$. Classical counterexample in analysis where a convergent sequence fail to be uniformly convergent. (b) Checking details, omitted. Ex.45.5 Let $X$ be a space. A subset $\\mathcal F$ of $C(X,\\Bbb R)$ is said to vanish uniformly at infinity if given $\\epsilon &gt; 0$, there is a compact subspace $C$ of $X$ such that $| f (x)| &lt; \\epsilon$ for $x\\in X − C$ and $f\\in F$ . If $\\mathcal F$ consists of a single function $f$ , we say simply that $f$ vanishes at infinity. Let $C_0(X,\\Bbb R)$ denote the set of continuous functions $f : X\\to R$ that vanish at infinity.Theorem. Let $X$ be locally compact Hausdorff; give $C_0(X,\\Bbb R)$ the uniform topology. A subset $\\mathcal F$ of $C_0(X,\\Bbb R)$ has compact closure if and only if it is pointwise bounded, equicontinuous, and vanishes uniformly at infinity. [Hint: Let $Y$ denote the one-point compactification of $X$. Show that $C_0(X,\\Bbb R)$ is isometric with a closed subspace of $C(Y,\\Bbb R)$ if both are given the sup metric.] We follow the hint. First we embed $C_0(X,\\Bbb R)$ into $C(Y,\\Bbb R)$ where $Y=X\\cup\\set{\\infty}$ is the one-point compactification of $X$. Let $\\eta:C_0(X,\\Bbb R)\\to C(Y,\\Bbb R)$ be $\\eta(f)|_X= f; \\eta(\\infty)=0$. It is clear that $\\eta$ is well defined since $f$ vanishes at infinity. And $\\eta$ is clearly an isometric. Now we prove that its image is closed. It is not hard to show that $f\\in\\mathrm{im}\\eta$ iff $f(\\infty)=0$. Indeed, $\\eta(f)(\\infty)=0$ holds by definition. Conversely, if $f(\\infty)=0$, then for each $\\epsilon&gt;0$ we can choose an open nbhd $U$ about $\\infty$ s.t. $f(U)\\in B(0,\\epsilon)$, but $U$ is a complement of a compact set $X$, thus $f|_X$ vanishes at infinity. Now, if $\\eta(f_n)$ converges to $g$, observing $g(\\infty)=0$ is sufficient to show $g\\in\\mathrm{im}\\eta$. So, $\\mathcal F$ has compact closure in $C_0(X,\\Bbb R)$ iff $\\mathcal F’=\\eta(\\mathcal F)$ has compact closure in $\\mathrm{im}\\eta$. By closedness $\\mathrm{Cl}_{\\mathrm{im}\\eta}\\mathcal F’=\\overline{\\mathcal F’}\\cap \\mathrm{im}\\eta=\\overline{\\mathcal F’}$ (because $\\overline{\\mathcal F’}\\subset \\mathrm{im}\\eta$). Thus $\\mathcal F$ has compact closure in $C_0(X,\\Bbb R)$ iff $\\mathcal F’$ has compact closure in $C(Y,\\Bbb R)$ iff $\\mathcal F’$ is pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. Finally, note that $\\mathcal F’$ is pointwise bounded iff $\\mathcal F$ is pointwise bounded. If $\\mathcal F’$ is equicontinuous, clearly $\\mathcal F$ is equicontinuous, and that $\\mathcal F’$ is equicontinuous at $\\infty$ implies that $f\\in\\mathcal F’$ can be arbitrarily small around $\\infty$, that is, arbitrarily small on complement of compact sets, i.e. $\\mathcal F$ vanishes at infinity. The reverse direction is similar. Thus $\\mathcal F’$ is equicontinuous actually means $\\mathcal F$ both is equicontinuous and vanishes at infinity. Done. Ex.45.6 Show that our proof of Ascoli’s theorem goes through if $\\Bbb R^n$ is replaced by any metric space in which all closed bounded subspaces are compact. Checking details, omitted. Ex.45.7Ex.45.8Hausdorff metric. §46 Pointwise and Compact ConvergenceEx.46.1 Show that the sets $B_C(f, \\epsilon)$ form a basis for a topology on $Y^X$. Given $B_C(f, \\epsilon)$ and $B_D(g, \\delta)$ where $C, D$ are compact, we need to show that their intersection contains some $B_F(h, \\gamma)$ for each $h$ in the intersection. Let $\\gamma=\\min\\set{\\epsilon-\\sup_{x\\in C} d(f(x),h(x)),\\delta-\\sup_{x\\in D} d(g(x),h(x))}$. Then: $B_{C\\cup D}(h,\\gamma)\\subset B_C(h,\\gamma)\\subset B_C(f,\\epsilon)$The last inclusion follows from triangular inequality: if $p\\in B_C(h,\\gamma)$, then over $C$ we have$$\\sup_C d(p(x),f(x))\\le \\sup_C d(p(x),h(x))+\\sup_C d(h(x),f(x))&lt;\\epsilon$$ Similarly, $B_{C\\cup D}(h,\\gamma)\\subset B_D(g,\\delta)$. Ex.46.2 Prove Theorem 46.7. Theorem 46.7. Let $X$ be a space; let $(Y, d)$ be a metric space. For the function space $Y^X$, one has the following inclusions of topologies: (uniform) ⊃ (compact convergence) ⊃ (pointwise convergence). If $X$ is compact, the first two coincide, and if $X$ is discrete, the second two coincide. That pointwise convergence topology is coarser than compact convergence topology is obvious, since a point is a compact set. As for the first two: Let $B_C(f,\\epsilon)$ be a basis element of compact convergence topology and g is in it, then it is obvious that $\\emptyset\\neq B_{\\bar\\rho}(g,\\epsilon-\\sup_C d(f(x),g(x)))\\subset B_C(f,\\epsilon)$. Therefore, the uniform topology is finer. If $X$ is compact, we have $B_X(f,\\epsilon)=B_{\\bar\\rho}(f,\\epsilon)$, thus the compact convergence topology is finer. Therefore, it coincides with the uniform topology. If $X$ is discrete, compact sets are precisely finite sets. Thus the basis elements of compact convergence topology coincides with those of pointwise topology. Ex.46.3 Show that the set $B(\\Bbb R,\\Bbb R)$ of bounded functions $f: \\Bbb R\\to \\Bbb R$ is closed in $\\Bbb R^{\\Bbb R}$ in the uniform topology, but not in the topology of compact convergence. That the uniform limit of bounded functions is bounded is a standard result in analysis. As for that bounded functions can converge to unbounded functions in compact convergence topology, consider functions:$$f_n(x)=\\begin{cases}0, x\\le 0\\\\x, 0\\le x\\le n\\\\n, x\\ge n\\end{cases}$$ On any compact set (bounded closed set) they converge to the ReLu function $\\Bbb 1_{x\\ge 0}\\cdot x$, which is unbounded. Ex.46.4 Consider the sequence of continuous functions $f_n : \\Bbb R\\to\\Bbb R$ defined by $f_n(x) = x/n$. In which of the three topologies of Theorem 46.7 does this sequence converge? Answer the same question for the sequence given in Exercise 9 of §21. $\\set{f_n}$ converges to $0$ in product topology and compact convergence topology. It doesn’t converge in uniform topology. Ex.46.5 Consider the sequence of functions $f_n : (−1, 1)\\to\\Bbb R$, defined by$$f_n(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty kx^k$$ (a) Show that $(f_n)$ converges in the topology of compact convergence; conclude that the limit function is continuous. (This is a standard fact about power series.)(b) Show that $(f_n)$ does not converge in the uniform topology. (a) Any compact set is covered by a closed interval, thus there exists an $M&lt;1$ such that $|kx^k|\\le kM^k$ for all $k$. $\\sum kM^k$ converges. By Weierstrass’ principle, the power series converges (uniformly) on compact sets. (b) $f_n$ converges pointwisely to $\\frac{x}{(1-x)^2}$. This convergence is not uniform, omitted. (consider the tail $R_N(x)\\ge (N+1)x^{N+1}$ and let $x=1-1/N$) Ex.46.6 Show that in the compact-open topology, $C(X, Y)$ is Hausdorff if $Y$ is Hausdorff, and regular if $Y$ is regular. [Hint: If $\\overline U ⊂ V$, then $S(C,U)\\subset S(C, V)$.] If $Y$ is Hausdorff, given $f\\neq g\\in C(X,Y)$ with $f(x)\\neq g(x)$, there are two disjoint open sets $U, V$ seperating them. Now $S(\\set{x}, U), S(\\set{y}, V)$ seperates $f,g$. If $Y$ is regular, given $f\\in C(X,Y)$ and $f\\in S(C,U)$, then there is an open set $V$ containing the compact set $f(C)$ so that $f(C)\\subset V\\subset\\overline V\\subset U$. We claim $f\\in S(C, V)\\subset\\overline{S(C,V)}\\subset S(C,U)$. If $g\\notin S(C,U)$, i.e. $\\exists c\\in C,g(c)\\notin U$, again by regularity there is an open nbhd $W$ of $g(c)$ s.t. $W\\cap \\overline V=\\emptyset$. Therefore $g\\in S(\\set{c}, W)$, and clearly $S(\\set{c}, W)\\cap S(C,V)=\\emptyset$. Thus we have proven $\\overline{S(C,V)}\\subset S(C,U)$. Ex.46.7 Show that if $Y$ is locally compact Hausdorff, then composition of maps $C(X,Y)\\times C(Y, Z)\\to C(X, Z)$ is continuous, provided the compact-open topology is used throughout. [Hint: If $g\\circ f ∈ S(C,U)$, find $V$ such that $f (C) ⊂ V$ and $g(\\overline V)\\subset U$.] Given $f\\in C(X,Y), g\\in C(Y,Z)$, and an open nbhd $g\\circ f\\in S(C,U)$. Then $f\\in S(C, g^{-1}(U))$ and $g\\in S(f(C), U)$. But $S(C, g^{-1}(U))\\times S(f(C), U)$ is not sufficient. For the conclusion we just need an open set $V$ such that $f(C)\\subset V$ and $g(\\overline V)\\subset U$ where $\\overline V$ is compact. Thus $S(C, V)\\times S(\\overline V, U)$ will be good. This is possible in a locally compact Hausdorff space. For every point $x$ in $f(C)$, we can choose an open nbhd $V_x$ of it so that $x\\in V_x\\subset\\overline{V_x}\\subset g^{-1}(U)$ and $\\overline{V_x}$ is compact. Since $f(C)$ is compact, we can cover it by finitely many such $V_x$. Take $V$ to be the union of them, which meets our requirements. Ex.46.8 Let $C’(X, Y)$ denote the set $C(X, Y)$ in some topology $\\tau$ . Show that if the evaluation map $e : X\\times C’(X, Y )\\to Y$ is continuous, then $\\tau$ contains the compact-open topology. [Hint: The induced map $E : C’(X, Y)\\to C(X, Y)$ is continuous.] We follow the hint. The induced map $E:C’(X,Y)\\to C(X,Y)$ is continuous. But, as you can check, this map equals to the identity map. Therefore, $C’(X,Y)$ has finer topology. Ex.46.9 Here is an (unexpected) application of Theorem 46.11 to quotient maps. (Compare Exercise 11 of §29.)Theorem. If $p : A\\to B$ is a quotient map and $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff, then $i_X\\times p : X\\times A → X\\times B$ is a quotient map.Proof.(a) Let $Y$ be the quotient space induced by $i_X\\times p$; let $q : X\\times A\\to Y$ be the quotient map. Show there is a bijective continuous map $f : Y\\to X\\times B$ such that $f\\circ q = i_X\\times p$.(b) Let $g = f^{-1}$. Let $G : B\\to C(X, Y )$ and $Q : A\\to C(X, Y )$ be the maps induced by $g$ and $q$, respectively. Show that $Q = G\\circ p$.(c) Show that $Q$ is continuous; conclude that $G$ is continuous, so that $g$ is continuous. (a) Use the universal property of quotient spaces. (b) Check by definition. (c) $Q$ is induced by $q$, hence continuous. Note that $p$ is quotient map. Given open set $U$ in $C(X,Y)$, that $G^{-1}U$ is open is equivalent to $q^{-1}G^{-1}U$ is open, i.e. $Q^{-1}U$ is open, which is true since $Q$ is continuous. Therefore, $G$ is continuous. Since $X$ is locally compact, $g$ is continuous. Hence $f$ is homeomorphism, $i_X\\times p$ is quotient map. Ex.46.10 A space is locally compact if it can be covered by open sets each of which is contained in a compact subspace of $X$. It is said to be $\\sigma$-compact if it can be covered by countably many such open sets.(a) Show that if $X$ is locally compact and second-countable, it is $\\sigma$-compact.(b) Let $(Y, d)$ be a metric space. Show that if $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact, there is a metric for the topology of compact convergence on $Y^X$ such that if $(Y, d)$ is complete, $Y^X$ is complete in this metric. [Hint: Let $A_1, A_2,\\dots $ be a countable collection of compact subspaces of $X$ whose interiors cover $X$. Let $Y_i$ denote the set of all functions from $A_i$ to $Y$ , in the uniform topology. Define a homeomorphism of $Y^X$ with a closed subspace of the product space $Y_1\\times Y_2\\dots$.] Let me note first that in some literatures a $\\sigma$-compact space is defined as a space that is union of countably many compact sets. They are NOT equivalent. Our one is weaker. A counterexample would be $\\Bbb Q\\subset\\Bbb R$ in usual topology. (In $\\Bbb Q$ every compact set has empty interior.) However, they are equivalent if $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff. (a) $X=\\bigcup U_\\alpha$ where each $U_\\alpha$ is contained in a compact set $C_\\alpha$. There is a countable basis for $X$, say $V_n$, each of which is contained in some $U_\\alpha$, therefore some $C_\\alpha$. Thus $X=\\bigcup V_n$ satisfies the definition. (b) We follow the hint. $Y_i$’s are complete because $Y$ is complete. Then the product $Y_0:=Y_1\\times Y_2\\times \\cdots$ is complete. Let’s prove that $Y^X$ is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of $Y_0$, thus we are done. Define a map $\\phi : Y^X\\to Y_0$ by $\\phi(f)=(f|_{A_1}, \\dots)$. It is clear that $\\phi$ is injective and continuous. Note that the compact convergence topology is initial w.r.t. the restriction maps onto compact sets. But $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact, thus it is initial w.r.t. the restriction maps onto $A_i$’s. Therefore, $\\phi$ is an embedding into the product space $Y_0$. Now let us characterize the image of $\\phi$:$$\\mathrm{im}\\phi=\\set{(f_1, f_2, \\ldots) \\big{|} f_i: A_i\\to Y, \\forall m,n,f_m|_ {A_m\\cap A_n}=f_n|_ {A_m\\cap A_n}}.$$ This is closed, because if $(f_i)\\notin\\mathrm{im}\\phi$, say $f_m|_ {A_m\\cap A_n}\\neq f_n|_ {A_m\\cap A_n}$ where $m&lt;n$, then by denoting $\\delta=\\sup_{A_m\\cap A_n}(f_m,f_n)$ we know that $A_1\\times\\dots\\times B_{\\bar\\rho_n}(f_n,\\delta/2)\\times\\dots\\times B_{\\bar\\rho_m}(f_m,\\delta/2)\\times\\dots$ has empty intersection with $\\mathrm{im}\\phi$. (The same holds if we replace $Y^X$ by $C(X,Y)$.) Ex.46.11 Let $(Y, d)$ be a metric space; let $X$ be a space. Define a topology on $C(X, Y)$ as follows: Given $f\\in C(X, Y)$, and given a positive continuous function $δ : X → \\Bbb R_+$ on $X$, let $B(f, \\delta) = \\set{g | d(f (x), g(x)) &lt; \\delta(x) \\text{ for all } x\\in X}$.(a) Show that the sets $B(f, \\delta)$ form a basis for a topology on $C(X, Y)$. We call it the fine topology.(b) Show that the fine topology contains the uniform topology.(c) Show that if $X$ is compact, the fine and uniform topologies agree.(d) Show that if $X$ is discrete, then $C(X, Y ) = Y^X$ and the fine and box topologies agree. (a) If $h\\in B(f,\\delta)\\cap B(g,\\gamma)$, let $d_f(x)=d(f(x),h(x)),d_g(x)=d(g(x),h(x))$. We know $d_f&lt; \\delta,d_g&lt;\\gamma$, hence $\\delta-d_f$ and $\\gamma-d_g$ are positive continuous functions. Then note that $B(h,\\min\\set{d_f,d_g})\\subset B(f,\\delta)\\cap B(g,\\gamma)$. (b) $B_\\bar\\rho(f,\\epsilon)\\subset B(f,\\epsilon)$, where the latter $\\epsilon$ stands for constant map. (c) If $X$ is compact, we have extreme value theorem, hence $B_\\bar\\rho(f,\\min\\delta)= B(f,\\delta)$. (d) $C(X, Y ) = Y^X$ is clear since $X$ is discrete.A basis open set for box topology is precisely $U=\\set{g|d(f(x),g(x))&lt;\\epsilon_x}$ about a function $f$, the map $x\\mapsto \\epsilon_x$ is continuous, therefore it is also what fine basis about $f$ would be. Hence fine and box toplogy agree. §47 Ascoli’s TheoremEx.47.1 Which of the following subsets of $C(\\Bbb R,\\Bbb R)$ are pointwise bounded? Which are equicontinuous?(a) The collection $\\set{f_n}$, where $f_n(x) = x + \\sin nx$.(b) The collection $\\set{g_n}$, where $g_n(x) = n + \\sin x$.(c) The collection $\\set{h_n}$, where $h_n(x) = |x|1/n$.(d) The collection $\\set{k_n}$, where $k_n(x) = n \\sin(x/n)$. Pointwise bounded: (a) (c) (d).equicontinuous: (b) (d). This shows by example that even in $C(\\Bbb R,\\Bbb R)$, pointwise boundedness and equicontinuity are independent. Ex.47.2 Prove the following:Theorem. If $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space, then a subspace $\\mathcal F$ of $C(X,\\Bbb R^n)$ in the topology of compact convergence has compact closure if and only if $\\mathcal F$ is pointwise bounded and equicontinuous under either of the standard metrics on $\\Bbb R^n$. First let’s compare this exercise with classical Ascoli’s theorem:Classical Ascoli’s theorem: $\\overline{\\mathcal F}$ has compact closure, provided $X$ is compact and $C(X,\\Bbb R^n)$ takes uniform topology.Ex.47.2: $\\overline{\\mathcal F}$ has compact closure, provided $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff and $C(X,\\Bbb R^n)$ takes compact convergence topology. This problem is clear from Ascoli’s theorem if you note by Ex.46.6 that $C(X,\\Bbb R^n)$ is Hausdorff, hence being contained in a compact is equivalent to having compact closure. Ex.47.3 Show that the general version of Ascoli’s theorem implies the classical version (Theorem 45.4) when $X$ is Hausdorff. When $X$ is compact, the uniform topology and the compact open topology agree. The rest goes the same as Ex.47.2. Ex.47.4 Prove the following:Theorem (Arzela’s theorem, general version). Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space that is $\\sigma$-compact; let $f_n$ be a sequence of functions $f_n : X\\to \\Bbb R^k$. If the collection $\\set{f_n}$ is pointwise bounded and equicontinuous, then the sequence $f_n$ has a subsequence that converges, in the topology of compact convergence, to a continuous function. [Hint: Show $C(X,\\Bbb R^k)$ is first-countable.] Recall Ex.46.10 shows that $(\\Bbb R^k)^X$ and $C(X, \\Bbb R^k)$ are topologically complete. $\\sigma$-compactness implies local compactness, thus Ex.47.2 shows that $\\set{f_n}$ has compact closure. Recall in metric spaces compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness. Ex.47.5 Let $(Y, d)$ be a metric space; let $f_n : X\\to Y$ be a sequence of continuous functions; let $f : X\\to Y$ be a function (not necessarily continuous). Suppose $f_n$ converges to $f$ in the topology of pointwise convergence. Show that if $\\set{f_n}$ is equicontinuous, then $f$ is continuous and $f_n$ converges to $f$ in the topology of compact convergence. First we prove continuity of $f$.$$d(f(x),f(x_0))\\le d(f(x), f_N(x)) + d(f_N(x),f_N(x_0)) + d(f_N(x_0),f(x_0))$$ Since $f_n$ is equicontinuous, we can choose an open nbhd of $x_0$ such that the first and the last term are sufficiently small for any $N$. Next choose $N$ large enough such that the middle term is sufficiently small. Next we prove that $f_n$ converges to $f$ in compact convergence topology. i.e. we need to prove that if an equicontinuous sequence $\\set{f_n}$ converges to $f$ pointwisely on a compact set, then the convergence is uniform. This is easy: Given $\\epsilon&gt;0$, by equicontinuity, for any point $x$ there is an open nbhd $U_x$ such that $d(f_n(x),f_n(y))&lt;\\epsilon$ on it. Cover the compact set with finitely many sets $U_{x_1},\\dots,U_{x_n}$, on each of which $d(f_n(x),f_n(x_i))&lt;\\epsilon$ holds. Suppose $x\\in U_i$, then we have:$$d(f_N(x),f(x))&lt;d(f_N(x),f_N(x_i)) + d(f_N(x_i),f(x_i)) + d(f(x_i),f(x))$$ The first term is smaller than $\\epsilon$ on $U_i$. The last term is smaller than $\\epsilon$ by taking $n\\to\\infty$ on the first term. The middle term is smaller than $\\epsilon$ if $N$ is sufficiently large. Therefore, $d(f_N(x),f(x))$ is dominated by $3\\epsilon$ on $U_k$ for large $N$, proving uniformity.","link":"/2025/01/15/Munkres-Topology-Solution-Chapter-7/"},{"title":"Munkres Topology Solution: Chapter 8","text":"§48 Baire SpacesEx.48.1 Let $X$ equal the countable union $\\bigcup B_n$. Show that if $X$ is a nonempty Baire space, at least one of the sets $\\overline{B_n}$ has a nonempty interior. $X=\\bigcup\\overline{B_n}$. If every $\\overline{B_n}$ has empty interior, since $X$ is Baire, their union has empty interior, contradiction. Ex.48.2 The Baire category theorem implies that $\\Bbb R$ cannot be written as a countable union of closed subsets having empty interiors. Show this fails if the sets are not required to be closed. $\\Bbb R=\\Bbb Q\\cup(\\Bbb R\\setminus\\Bbb Q)$. Ex.48.3 Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space. A direct proof goes similarly to compact Hausdorff case. Let $A_n$ be closed sets with empty interiors and $U_0\\subset X$ be any open set. Since $\\mathrm{int} A_1=\\emptyset$, $U_0\\not\\subset A_1$. So there exists $x\\in U_0\\setminus A_1$. Since $X$ is regular, we can find open nbhd $U_1$ about $x$ such that $U_0\\supset \\overline{U_1}\\supset U_1$. And, since $X$ is locally compact, we can choose $U_1$ such that it has compact closure. Proceed recursively, we have $U_0\\supset \\overline{U_1}\\supset U_1\\supset \\overline{U_2}\\supset\\dots$, with $U_i\\not\\subset A_{i+1}$ and $\\overline{U_i}$ being compact. $\\overline{U_1}$ is compact, thus having finite intersection property: $\\bigcap U_i\\neq\\emptyset$. Any $x\\in\\bigcap U_i$ will lie in $U_0$ but outside of $\\bigcup A_i$. An alternative proof is: the one-point compactification of $X$ is Baire, while $X$ is its open subspace, hence $X$ is Baire. Ex.48.4 Show that if every point $x$ of $X$ has a neighborhood that is a Baire space, then $X$ is a Baire space. [Hint: Use the open set formulation of the Baire condition.] Let $U_n$ be a sequence of dense open sets. For each point $x\\in X$, it has an open nbhd $U$ that is itself Baire. $U\\cap U_n$ is a sequence of dense open sets in $U$, thus $U\\cap\\bigcap U_n$ is dense in $U$. In particular, $U\\cap\\bigcap U_n\\neq\\emptyset$. Now if $V$ is an arbitrary nonempty open set, choose such $U$ above and note that $U\\cap V$ is Baire, thus $U\\cap V\\cap\\bigcap U_n\\neq\\emptyset$. Ex.48.5 Show that if $Y$ is a $G_\\delta$ set in $X$, and if $X$ is compact Hausdorff or complete metric, then $Y$ is a Baire space in the subspace topology. [Hint: Suppose that $Y = \\bigcap W_n$, where $W_n$ is open in $X$, and that $B_n$ is closed in $Y$ and has empty interior in $Y$. Given $U_0$ open in $X$ with $U_0\\cap Y\\neq\\emptyset$, find a sequence of open sets $U_n$ of $X$ with $U_n\\cap Y$ nonempty, such that$$\\begin{aligned}\\overline{U_n}&amp;\\subset U_{n-1}\\\\\\overline{U_n}\\cap\\overline{B_n}&amp;=\\emptyset\\\\\\mathrm{diam}U_n&amp;&lt;1/n, \\text{in the metric case}\\\\\\overline{U_n}&amp;\\subset W_n.]\\end{aligned}$$ Note that topological completeness is $G_\\delta$ hereditary, so we don’t need to prove the metric case. For the other case, suppose $Y=\\bigcap W_n$. Since compactness and Hausdorff-ness are closed hereditary, we can WLOG assume $Y$ is dense. Suppose $V_n$ is a sequence of dense open sets in $Y$, thus dense in $X$. Assume $V_n=U_n\\cap Y$ where $U_n$ are open sets in $X$. Then $\\bigcap V_n=\\bigcap U_n\\cap\\bigcap W_n$. However, since $U_n$ and $W_n$ are all dense open sets, we know $\\bigcap V_n$ is dense. Ex.48.6 Show that the irrationals are a Baire space. $\\Bbb R\\setminus\\Bbb Q$ is a $G_\\delta$ subset of $\\Bbb R$. Ex.48.7 Prove the following:Theorem. If $D$ is a countable dense subset of $\\Bbb R$, there is no function $f : \\Bbb R\\to\\Bbb R$ that is continuous precisely at the points of $D$.Proof.(a) Show that if $f: \\Bbb R\\to\\Bbb R$, then the set $C$ of points at which $f$ is continuous is a $G_\\delta$ set in $\\Bbb R$. [Hint: Let $U_n$ be the union of all open sets $U$ of $\\Bbb R$ such that $\\mathrm{diam} f (U) &lt; 1/n$. Show that $C =\\bigcap U_n$.](b) Show that $D$ is not a $G_\\delta$ set in $\\Bbb R$. [Hint: Suppose $D = \\bigcap W_n$, where $W_n$ is open in $\\Bbb R$. For $d\\in D$, set $V_d = \\Bbb R − \\set{d}$. Show Wn and $V_d$ are dense in $\\Bbb R$.] (a) $$\\set{x|f\\text{ continuous at } x}=\\bigcap_n\\bigcup_m\\set{x|\\forall s,t\\in(x-\\frac1m,x+\\frac1m),|f(s)-f(t)|&lt;\\frac1n},$$ which is a $G_\\delta$ set. (b) Generally, a $G_\\delta$ dense subset of $\\Bbb R$ cannot be countable. Otherwise $D=\\bigcap W_n$ is an intersection of countable dense open sets. By Baire category theorem, $\\bigcap W_n\\cap\\bigcap _{d\\in D}(\\Bbb R\\setminus\\set{d})$ is dense. But this equals $\\emptyset$, a contradiction. Ex.48.8 If $f_n$ is a sequence of continuous functions $f_n : \\Bbb R\\to \\Bbb R$ such that $f_n(x) → f (x)$ for each $x\\in\\Bbb R$, show that $f$ is continuous at uncountably many points of $\\Bbb R$. By theorem 48.5, the set of continuous point of $f$ is dense. By Ex.48.7, it is not countable. Ex.48.9 Let $g :\\Bbb Z_+\\to\\Bbb Q$ be a bijective function; let $x_n = g(n)$. Define $f : \\Bbb R\\to\\Bbb R$ as follows: $f(x_n) = 1/n$ for $x_n\\in\\Bbb Q$, $f(x) =0$ for $x\\notin\\Bbb Q$. Show that $f$ is continuous at each irrational and discontinuous at each rational. Can you find a sequence of continuous functions fn coverging to $f$? That $f$ is continuous precisely at irrationals is a standard fact in analysis. However, I haven’t proven or denied the existence of such $f_n$… Ex.48.10 Prove the following:Theorem (Uniform boundedness principle). Let $X$ be a complete metric space, and let $\\mathcal F$ be a subset of $C(X,\\Bbb R)$ such that for each $a\\in X$, the set $$\\mathcal F_a = \\set{ f (a) | f\\in\\mathcal F }$$ is bounded. Then there is a nonempty open set $U$ of $X$ on which the functions in $\\mathcal F$ are uniformly bounded, that is, there is a number $M$ such that $|f (x)|\\le M$ for all $x\\in U$ and all $f\\in\\mathcal F$ . [Hint: Let $A_N = \\set{x; | f (x)|\\le N \\text{ for all } f\\in F }$.] We follow the hint. Clearly $X=\\bigcup A_n$ since $\\mathcal F$ is pointwise bounded, and $A_n$ is a sequence of closed sets. By Ex.48.1, there is at least one set, say $A_{n_0}$, has nonempty interior, and write $U=\\mathrm{int}A_{n_0}$. By definition this is what we want. Ex.48.11 Determine whether or not $\\Bbb R_l$ is a Baire space. Yes. First we claim: a subset $D\\subset \\Bbb R$ is dense in usual topology, if, and only if it is dense in lower limit topology. Suppose it is dense in usual topology. Now given any point $x$, any open nbhd (in $\\Bbb R_l$) $[x,x+\\epsilon)$, note that $D\\cap [x,\\infty)$ is also dense in $[x,\\infty)$ in usual topology, and $[x,x+\\epsilon)$ is open in this topology. Hence $[x,x+\\epsilon)\\cap D\\neq\\emptyset$. (NOTE: I am not asserting that if $D$ dense, $A$ closed, then $D\\cap A$ dense in $A$! This is true when $\\mathrm{int}A\\neq\\emptyset$, or when $A$ is open. You can also check this claim directly.) As for this problem, let $W_n=\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in J_n}[a_{n,\\alpha},b_{n,\\alpha})$ be a sequence of dense open sets in $\\Bbb R_l$. Now note that any open nbhd (in $\\Bbb R_l$) intersects $W_n$, it must intersects some $(a_{n,\\alpha},b_{n,\\alpha})$. i.e. $W_n’=\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in J_n}(a_{n,\\alpha},b_{n,\\alpha})$ is a sequence of dense open sets in $\\Bbb R_l$, so dense in $\\Bbb R$. Therefore, $\\bigcup W_n\\supset\\bigcup W_n’$ is dense. Ex.48.12 Show that $\\Bbb R^J$ is a Baire space in the box, product, and uniform topologies. For uniform topology $\\Bbb R^J$ is clearly Baire, since it is complete. For product topology, there is no hope for $\\Bbb R^J$ to be locally compact or complete metric, since it is not normal if $|J|\\ge \\mathfrak c$. But we can mimic the proof of theorem 49.2 again. All we need to prove is: if $U_0\\supset\\overline{U_1}\\supset U_1\\supset…$, then $\\bigcap U_n\\neq\\emptyset$. However, this follows easily from the fact that a descending sequence of CLOSED intervals has nonempty intersection. The same applies to box topology. Ex.48.13 Let $X$ be a topological space; let $Y$ be a complete metric space. Show that $C(X, Y )$ is a Baire space in the fine topology (see Exercise 11 of §46). [Hint: Given basis elements $B( f_i, \\delta_i )$ such that $\\delta_1\\le 1$ and $\\delta_{i+1}\\le \\delta_i /3$ and $f_{i+1}\\in B( f_i, δ_i /3)$, show that $\\bigcap B( f_i, \\delta_i )\\neq \\emptyset$.] Again, we mimic the proof of theorem 49.2. First, we show $C(X,Y)$ in the fine toplogy is regular. This is easy. Given $f\\in B(f,\\delta)$, we need to show $\\overline{B(f,\\delta/2)}\\subset B(f,\\delta)$. Suppose $g\\notin B(f,\\delta)$, then $B(g,\\delta/2)\\cap B(f,\\delta/2)=\\emptyset$. Done. Next, follow the proof of theorem 49.2, we get a descending chain: $B(f_1,\\delta_1)\\supset\\overline{B(f_2,\\delta_2)}\\supset B(f_2,\\delta_2)\\supset…$ with $\\delta_1\\le 1$ and $\\delta_{i+1}\\le \\delta_i /3$. We are going to show it has nonempty limit. For any $\\epsilon&gt;0$, find $N$ such that $(1/3)^N&lt;\\epsilon$, then for $m&gt;n\\ge N$, $f_m, f_n\\in B(f_N,\\delta_N)$, so $\\bar\\rho(f_n,f_N)&lt;\\epsilon, \\bar\\rho(f_m,f_N)&lt;\\epsilon$. Hence $\\bar\\rho(f_n,f_m)&lt;2\\epsilon$. This implies that $f_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in the uniform topology. Note that $C(X,Y)$ in the uniform topology is complete, so it has a uniform limit $f$, which is continuous. Therefore, $f\\in\\bigcap B(f_n,\\delta_n)$. 执笔至此，发现维数理论已经全部忘记，索性就写到这吧。维数理论我应该会在准备博资考复习的时候再看一遍，到时通过考试后应该会补充上的，包括前面一些没写的，比如Hausdorff

有一句话我的印象很深刻：If you can’t be a poet, be a poem. 我为自己的研究生方向选择了基础数学，而且是一个在基础数学中都算冷门的方向，有时候难免在夜不能寐时反问自己是否把路走太窄了。我一直深知自己在数学方面实在没太多天赋，仅凭年轻的头铁走到现在，虽还没撞到南墙，却时不时觉着前方有一堵障碍，我始终活在它的阴影之下，不知何时会碰上。 做数学就是写诗，这毫无疑问，无论是调侃为竞赛命题学的数学，还是做前沿的数学，都是在写一首首晦涩的诗，但我本科以来就很少体会到自己谱诗的乐趣，常常是无从下手，最后只能欣赏他人的作品。是否能顺利毕业呢，毕业后又何去何从，这些我都不敢去考虑，作为没有天赋的人走这条路，注定是付出比别人更多的努力，最后拿着比同龄人普遍低的回报。但是话又说回来，我失眠的夜晚，往往是困在更广阔的生与死的问题，那么既然人只能活这一辈子，还不去追求自己的理想，稀里糊涂地赶路，岂不悲哉？一位老师讲过，所爱和所长重叠，实在可遇不可求，对于大多数人来说，所爱与所长，总要做出选择。所以既然我注定成不了诗人，那么我暂时选择成为一首诗。 回想这本科这三年的经历，我有一段时间像个中二少年一样，将自己伪装成沉浸在数学中的角色，对周遭的一切漠不关心，冷淡。但逐渐的才意识到自己正值而立之年，却整日在泡影一样的世界中，错过了世界的太多美好，我想到每天摸鱼学几个法语单词的日子里看到的一句话：La vérité ne se trouve d’ailleurs pas dans les livres, mais dans la vie. 真相不在书中，而在生活里。如果错过生活里的细节，那对自己灵魂的理解往往只存在自己大脑编造的幻象里，进行着某种角色扮演。 别人问我喜欢在乡村还是城市呢，一年前我将毫不犹豫地选择乡村，因为哪怕小时候在农村长大，我却也没甚干过农活，于是总只是在幻想乡村中静谧平淡的日子，幻想自己喜欢一个人独居。但走过了更多地方后，我才明白自己其实离不开城市的喧嚣，我喜欢独处，但喜欢的是将自己置身在人群、车海中的孤独，喜欢作为旁观者观察海量的故事与细节，就像摩天大楼随机一层楼晚上的一盏灯，然后才终于明白小时候喜欢的一些游戏为何吸引我。所以我才说，想做一首世俗的诗。我做不到超然世外，我离不开世俗的景色。","link":"/2024/07/12/%E5%81%9A%E4%B8%80%E9%A6%96%E4%B8%96%E4%BF%97%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%97/"},{"title":"上海、杭州游记","text":"前言旅行的意义是什么？我是说，在技术无所不能的前夕，互联网可以找到远比个人旅行能获取的更多信息，纪念品可以在网络上购到，占据大多数人旅行之大部分的人景合照可以由ps技术得到或ai生成。虽然我也同意目前技术还做不到完美，但倘若——我们就作这样的假设：技术若真发展到完美的地步，那么旅行的意义还余下些什么？毕竟大多数人的旅行基本只有拍照、品尝与观景。 有一个颇有哲学含义的定理这样是说的，$A\\cong B\\Leftrightarrow \\mathrm{Hom}(-, A)\\cong\\mathrm{Hom}(-, B)$。一件事物之完整内涵无外乎对其一切的感知或反之。风是客观存在的事物，而我感受到了面颊的吹拂，便知道了风的存在；我看到树的摇曳，便知道了风的方向；如果我还恰好站在老家的麦田中，那风便拥有了形状……如果有人能穷尽一切途径去观察这风，那他不多不少正好可以还原这风的整个面貌。 上海上海是我一直想去的地方之一，但是并没有一个很明确的原因，因为我并不喜欢过于繁华的街道。三年前如果有人问我在静谧的乡村和繁华的城市之间选择一个作为居住地，我会毫不犹豫地选择乡村。一方面是受父母辈的影响，我的父母都来自农村，而且多次与我谈到退休后的生活，他们都更想翻修农村的老房子后在那边生活。我从小几乎没出过省，甚至连学校所在的县都没怎么出过，整个人生轨迹就是从遂宁迁出后在罗江县城学校附近、金山镇口与成都的住处辗转，就仿佛我高中那三点一线的日常放大版，扩大到以年为单位的人生而已。因此我便凭着一些猜测加模糊的印象，认为乡村的生活应该更合乎我的口味。直到最近我才开始质疑起自己，真的是这样吗？ 我非常喜欢一款游戏《镜之边缘》，小时候电脑配置不够，只能玩一代，二代根本启动不了，只能在视频网站上看宣传片和实况过过瘾。后来放假时到姨夫家中蹭电脑玩，他们家的电脑配置稍微好一点，我开着最低的画质和分辨率玩了一部分剧情，收假后还回味无穷。我永远忘不了一代结束时摄像机抬起后伴随《Still Alive》展开的镜之城夜景，当时不知道怎的就触动了我的神经，下面许多楼房都是之前关卡所在，现在想来，正是那种面对着由海量与自己相关的细节组成的世界。后来寻遍天下游戏，几乎找不到第二款能给我同样感觉的游戏。后来上大学换了电脑，终于能正常游玩催化剂，我是买下来后反复把玩，一款半成品几乎没有实质的开放世界的单机游戏能玩上两三百小时，这在我其他游戏时间中实属罕见。 这次来到上海，回想起游戏中那个令我无法忘怀的镜头，虽然知道东方明珠人多得骇人，我还是执意说想上去看看。幸好同伴也没有多抱怨，到地方就开始排队，后来排了快三个小时才终于登上塔顶，尽管天气也很炎热，同伴却也没说什么（旅行选好同伴真的很重要，换作别人估计要吵架了）。我在塔上转了若干圈，因为手机摄像头不好，让同伴帮着拍了几张俯瞰图，算是了了童年的一桩心愿。又去上面几层的玻璃栈道看了一下，可惜玻璃已经脏得看不清下方，只有模糊的光圈，不到一小时便又下了来。 我在东方明珠上亲眼看到了屡次出现在我梦中的繁华，晚上躺在床上，却总觉和我的期待略有偏差。辗转反侧思来想去，认为是上海这种至极的繁华和我距离太遥远了，不像是我的生活，或者与我能有联系。有时候梦想照进现实，才发现这多年梦想不是自己想要的。 后来几天还去了爱情公寓的外景取景地，拍了照片，算是打了卡，不过并未留下什么特殊的印象，看来有些感动只适合存在自己的脑海里。 杭州这次出游，杭州给了我莫大的惊喜。本来杭州对这次旅行来说只是一个中转地，从上海到德清比赛回来，到杭州比较近，机票也较便宜而已。杭州的美食极其难吃，尤其是最出名的几样：醋鱼、东坡肉等，令人很失望，这段就不再写了。 最令我惊讶的是城市阳台这里。我在这里找到了东方明珠上缺失的那块感觉. 杭州是一个同样繁华的城市，但在城市阳台与对岸隔江相望，却给了我在上海无论如何也找不到的安心感。虽然东方明珠与外滩也有一江之隔，但两岸都太喧闹，甚至珠江水面都难得平静。而钱塘江的静谧却巧妙地嵌入到两岸的繁华中，中间的大桥像两条波涛汹涌的大河间的涓涓细流，沟通着两边的繁忙和成千上万的故事。 我当晚在城市阳台上站了很久，用我的手机也好同伴的手机也好，无论如何也拍不出我当时心头的激动，在我看来，完全就是我在催化剂的夜晚获得的感动，就像时隔多年又闻到外婆做的渣海椒（听说嗅觉直通海马体，所以做这个比喻），灵魂瞬间穿越在两个时间点间。 城市阳台的人并不多，甚至可以说安静，我可以随意在附近走动和驻足，不像外滩需要见缝插针地找角度拍照。我有一瞬间感到这就是我想定居的城市，这个意境，就是我前十余年所寻找的。只有这时才真正体会到词不达意之人的悲哀。 后来我又想了想，确信我所期待的正是这种在某处安静的角落观察城市繁华的机会，是这种置身事外的逍遥。我希望我能处在一个足够热闹的世界，但并不想置自身在其中。当我自己真正站在人潮人海中时，就像在上海外滩那天一样，我会感到迷茫，甚至于惶恐，感觉不到自己的存在。对于自己周围的一亩三分地，我更想安静、简单一点。
